The purpose of this report is to describe how the function of staff management should be established – to clarify the PH strategy and operations.
Currently, the PH-function department is missing.
The idea of this report was in the debate on the Dace Roz leader of the EUPU.
However, the content of the PH-plan was also discussed with other entities: Anita Bisofa, Valda Ceputers and Valdis Bisters.
The Moe Investment Department is growing rapidly and is facing many changes over the coming years.
Possible changes in the department's organisation are already at stake.
The pressure to deal effectively and correctly with the work processes and staff matters is urgent.
In the current situation, directors and entities are so busy with projects, so that there is no time for the development of PH.
It is very desirable to appoint a person responsible for the PH to focus on the establishment of the Human Resources Management System and would be able to develop it in the future in accordance with practical needs.
Prior to the planning of the PHU PH, the division and mission of the department must be clear.
The Investment Department strategy and the short-term action plan are recommended annually.
The participation of the EU, but also in national programmes, should be stressed in accordance with the real need.
The number of projects will increase considerably and more projects will reach the implementation phase affecting the number of workers needed and their areas of competence.
Soon, the PRK (the Handbook of implementation of the project) and the PKJ (project guide) will be prepared.
They should be used in this autumn.
The PRK shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the relevant sub-processes.
These instructions provide practical guidance on both the flow of work and the organisation.
These instructions should serve as a basis for the following steps such as writing and identifying the fields of competence.
The measures necessary for the development and further practical needs of the staff management system are described in Annex III.
The initial plan for the establishment of the PH-system is set out in Annex IV.
The plan would be a presumption that the staff manager / coordinator can start full-time work on the PH development at the beginning of December 2003.
The Director and the Heads of Unit of the Department should cooperate closely with the staff management staff, to inform him of the need for continuous development and prioritise it.
They are also responsible for the development of development and the discussion of the scoreboard; staff management will contribute to the upgrading of templates and storage files.
The Heads of Unit must play an active role in developing issues and content of competences.
The self-assessment of competences involves all staff.
Staff management coordinates the evaluation of competences and manages data files.
The draft budget for the year 2004 shall include both the costs of the PH development (mainly the PH-worker, the staff of the units, the IT staff) and the cost of training.
Implementation costs consist of direct costs (e.g. courses, lecturers, materials), teaching and training, training and training of training participants, and training and facilitation of training.
Once a year, due to the lost working time, the cost also arises from evaluation and PLP.
An approximate estimate of the provision of training activities in 2004 must be provided before any budgetary figures are offered.

In the light of the invitation to the March 2005 Council meeting, Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for 2005-2008 (‘ the programme ’), with a view to promoting national growth and employment.
The programme is a policy planning document, showing how the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in 2005-2008 will achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, in line with the integrated guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005.
The programme reflects the most important problems of the Lisbon Strategy in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and identify the main features of these problems and actions, but also the performance indicators for achieving these objectives.
The programme is based on the policy planning documents approved by the Republic of Latvia.
The programme was assisted by the Lisbon Council.
It was consulted (Latvian Parliament) and social partners.
The programme consists of an introductory part (macroeconomic policy, microeconomic reforms, employment policy guidelines) and annexes.
All numerical information and figures were received from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Latvia or Eurostat, except in cases specifically referred to.
In order to achieve these objectives, the ministries will establish strategic plans for the preparation of strategic planning principles in line with the priorities set by the government, in line with the priorities set by the government in the medium-term development policy and programmes and sub-programmes, including their funding, and including their funding, and including their funding, and their funding, including their funding.
To ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area,
Adopted the Ministerial Cabinet of 21 July 2005 to establish a European single currency in Latvia with the task of developing a plan for the adoption of the necessary measures to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area.
On 31 December 2004, public debt amounted to 975 million latin or 13,3% of GDP.
It is expected that public debt will increase gradually in the coming years and may reach 13.6% of GDP in 2008.
Latvia ’ s public debt is one of the smallest, and is expected to remain significantly below the State gross debt criterion in the medium term (60% of GDP), as defined in the Maastricht Treaty.
On the basis of the information provided, Latvia does not have the urgent need to develop a specific plan to reduce public debt, but before any measures are taken in the area of government debt management, careful analysis of the risks to the country is required to ensure the most favourable transaction.
The main proposed measures in the area of sovereign debt 2005-2008 (Guideline 2).
To ensure the necessary resources to finance the public budget deficit and to refinance sovereign debt commitments as minimum as possible, by limiting financial risks and taking into account the development of the capital market and all financial systems of Latvia (responsible authority:
– to develop new debt repurchase and debt exchange programmes to manage debt refinancing risks in order to draw on the opportunities offered by the capital market to attract long-term resources,
- In continuing to reduce the cost of external debt of the country, all existing provisions of external lending agreements will be reviewed in order to assess the future repayment of a number of loans in the future, refinancing these loans with other more favourable loans or possible restrictions and existing restrictions on the existing restrictions.
The sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed positively and characterised by relatively low public debt, but also adequate budgetary discipline.
Latvia's commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as the objective of joining the euro area, is another additional guarantee of positive trends in the current budgetary position.
In a long-term perspective, the sustainability of public finances is mainly influenced by population ageing, resulting in a shrinking working-age population and their role in the population and the demographic burden.
The initial calculations of financial sustainability show that the ageing of the population affects Latvian society and the economy and public finances, but thanks to the pension reform that has been introduced, it does not result in undue consequences.
Latvia ’ s small public debt and pressure pressures will give government some flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances.
It should be noted, however, that an ageing population makes a new approach to health care.
The distribution of health expenditure according to age groups clearly shows that higher costs will fall to older people whose number increases significantly over the next 50 years.
Long-term care costs are currently relatively small in Latvia, due to limited resources from both government and local authorities, but also from society's traditions and values.
At the same time, the health of other demographic groups must also be ensured, as the overall level of morbidity is high.
The government will develop an effective health system based on long-term prospects.
In order to adapt significantly to the current demographic situation, changes in national monetary policy are necessary.
As the demographic burden will increase in the long term, the increase in productivity based on living standards in all population groups plays a decisive role in increasing productivity.
It is therefore important to ensure that Latvia's main wealth – training of people in line with labour market demands – to create a accessible labour market (see section 3).
The forest, as it meets the requirements of the wood processing, the largest export sector in the Latvian industry, is also an important contribution to the overall development of the Latvian country's economy.
The forest is also an important resource for rural development, as it provides a livelihood for residents working in local areas, 150 000 forest owners and forestry companies.
Part of the revenue generated by the final and harbor harvesting or services shall be invested by the forest owner in order to maintain the value of the forest or to introduce continuous production.
The largest forest owners (the country, local authorities and some of the private sector companies to whom thousands of hectares of forest land) can be guaranteed throughout the long term management cycle.
Taking into account the composition, age, structure, previous administrative practice of the species, the economic situation of the rural area, but also the knowledge of forest owners is a constant obstacle to forest production in small forest owners.
These circumstances are currently insufficient in order to restore the value of forest value (revenues); therefore, it is necessary to promote the production of wood (the timely and high-quality renewal of the forest, the use of selected forest reproductive material, the cultivation of the forest, the cultivation of young people), particularly in the private sector.
Although Latvia's waste management systems have been complemented and the awareness of society about the need to reduce waste, the amount of garbage generated is increasing every year.
The possibilities for garbage processing and decommissioning are insufficient, although companies can obtain subsidies from the environmental protection fund from the Latvian environmental protection fund for collection and disposal of waste from environmentally harmful goods.
Water management infrastructures (water supply and sewage collection and handling) are insufficiently developed and obsolete, its capacity is not economically viable, the technologies used are energy intensive and not all environmental requirements.
It limits the development of the activity, particularly in remote regions in the country.
Access to water management infrastructure is highly affected by the development of public utilities, social catering, health and tourism industries.
Latvia must determine the time-limit for transposition of internal market rules, but also to ensure monitoring of the transposition of the directives on supervision and political level at national level.
As at 7 September 2005 Latvia had not notified 1.3% of the transposition of EU directives (or 0.5% of the total number of directives).
Given that 99.5% of the Directives had been transposed into Latvian standards as at 7 September 2005, it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective is achieved by at least 98,5% of the transposition or a deficit deficit of 1.5% directives.
Transposition and implementation of internal market directives will depend directly on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation.
At present, the effective transposition of EU legislation is not an effective database, which would provide the possibility of monitoring the transposition process over a number of reference points, and thus, in addition to other circumstances, the transposition process and the establishment of the EU internal market base.
The shortage of public administrations in the country reduces their capacity to ensure a qualitative and timely compliance with the transposition process of EU directives.
The restrictions on the freedoms of the EU internal market were most lost before Latvia's accession to the EU, but the barriers to transactions above borders are still there.
Significant obstacles arise from existing licensing requirements and time-consuming administrative operations requiring companies to receive additional money and time and the worst of small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and consistency of existing systems of licensing and other restrictions on the EU requirements, including free professions (lawyers, notaries, accountants, architects, engineers and pharmacists) to promote competitiveness in these sectors.
In order to introduce harmonised and harmonised competition policy, the Latvian competition standards were harmonised in 2004 according to the EU competition standards.
In case of obstacles to competition across borders or in order to prevent any distortion of competition, the Latvian Competition Authority (NCA) - the Competition Council - active cooperation with the European Commission and the Authority's competition authorities.
The electricity market is gradually opening.
As at 1 July 2004, the threshold for the status of qualified customers was set at 0.0 GWh.
Therefore, only households can only choose the supplier, and the opening up of the electricity market is up to 75%.
Until now, no electricity supplier has changed the electricity supplier.
In order to stimulate competition and encourage the entry of alternative suppliers, the functions of transmission and distribution of electricity need to be legally and functionally separated from the functions of electricity generation and sales.
The conditions for electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law.
The EU will build our common future and take global commitments, using only 1% of their wealth per year.
The focus of the Cultural Decisions on the challenges of today's world is to meet the challenges of the EU's citizens in the interests of better life.
The European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the EU.
This part of our website will find information on how Parliament will organise its work through the various committees.
Parliament plays an active role in drawing up legislation on the daily lives of its citizens, such as environmental protection, consumer rights, equal opportunities, transport and the free movement of workers, capital, services and goods, and the Council and the Council have a common European Union budget.
The European Parliament consists of 736 members elected from 27 Member States of the enlarged European Union.
Since 1979, MEPs have elected direct and universal elections for five years.
Each Member State shall decide on the form of elections organised but must comply with the same democratic basic rules: gender equality and secret ballot.
In all Member States, 18 years of electoral rights, except Austria, where it is 16 years.
The European elections are already governed by a number of common principles: direct and general elections, proportionate representation and five-year term of office.
As a general rule, the proportion of the population of each Member State shall be distributed.
Each Member State has a certain number of seats – most 99 and less than 5.
Equality between men and women: the role of women in the European Parliament is strongly increasing.
A few more than one third of MEPs are women.
MEPs will share their time between Brussels, Strasbourg and his district, and they will attend parliamentary committees and political groups and plenary sessions in Strasbourg.
In parallel, they must, of course, devote time to their community.
Members of the European Parliament are grouped in common political views, not by nationality.
They shall exercise their mandate independently.
As the power of Members of the European Parliament is increasing, they influence all the everyday lives of citizens: the environment, consumer protection, transport and education, as well as education, culture, health, etc.
The new statute for Members of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 in the new statute, the working conditions of a Member of the EP have been made more transparent and it introduces the same remuneration for all members of the EU budget.
All Community languages are equally important in the European Parliament: all Parliament's documents will be published in all the official languages of the European Union (EU) and each member of the European Parliament.
What would be better to ensure the transparency and accessibility of Parliament's work throughout the public?
The multilingualism of the European treaties firmly reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union.
It also makes the European institutions more accessible and transparent to help ensure the success of the EU's democratic system.
The European Parliament distinguishes from other EU institutions to ensure a multilingualism in the largest possible extent.
All EU citizens must be able to acquaint themselves with legislation directly affecting them in their own language.
And since every European citizen has the right to stand in elections to the European Parliament, it is unreasonable to require the members of a common language to have a perfect possession of a common language.
The right of each member to read Parliament's documents in his language, to observe the debates and to take the floor explicitly laid down in Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
In addition, the European Parliament, as the legislator, must ensure the good linguistic quality of all the acts adopted in the official languages.
In addition, the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament's work, ask questions and receive answers in their language.
The European Parliament in its resolution of 9 October states that "experience gained from previous European elections and referendums demonstrates that they are more likely to take part in people who are aware of the issues related to the EU and are less interested and less informed of the participation of less informed citizens".
On the eve of the European elections in October 2009, the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration on Communicating Europe in Partnership to stress the need for political readiness for all EU institutions and all levels of the Member States to work on the European Union.
The main objective of the joint declaration is to provide citizens with fair and diverse information on the EU, so that they can actively engage in public debate on European Union issues.
In the joint declaration, the EU took the task of resolving problems with the Member States in cooperation with the Member States, in order to ensure communication with the greatest target group at the right levels.
In this context, they expressed their desire to develop synergies with national, regional and local authorities and representatives of civil society.
Although each Member State and each institution have its communication strategy and its priorities, Parliament agreed to establish a small number of common communication priorities for each year, together with the Council, the Council and the Commission.
In addition, the Commission invites the other EU institutions at the beginning of each year to feedback from the main achievements in implementing the common communication priorities of the previous year.

Good health is an important issue for Europeans and governments of these countries.
The EU is therefore at the forefront of the efforts to protect and combat climate change.
Since pollution does not feel boundaries, the EU has been working together for years in this area.
It is not surprising that Europe's rivers and beaches are cleaner, cars polluting less and strict rules on waste management.
Europe's hazardous waste can no longer be transported to poor countries.
Strict EU rules also apply to the safety of chemicals used by companies and the environment.
The EU aims to make transport, industry, agriculture and tourism work so that they do not destroy natural resources – in other words that development is sustainable.
In order to stop climate change, the EU has agreed on strict measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020.
Energy is the cornerstone of the EU's long-term climate policy and the EU has set binding targets for wind, hydro- and solar energy and other clean renewable energy sources.
In addition to combating climate change, it helps to promote the economy and to secure more stable energy supply by reducing European dependence on foreign oil and gas imports.
The EU has already put in place an innovative emission trading scheme, thanks to which energy-consuming companies can benefit from reducing energy consumption and will be punished by companies crossing the borders.
The euro (€) is probably one of the EU's tangible achievements.
The single currency is in use in 16 countries in which more than two thirds of the EU population lives.
Other countries will join if their economies are ready for this.

"Pull out the handle with caution."
He wasn't the only son of his father, even though he was the oldest, his brother William was on the side of his business in Cuckold, the Cuckold and the greenhouses on the side of the Cuckold.
The Municipality of Municipality was found in a number of places, but the Clan Morgans - who believed to have migrated from Wales in times of time - had lived here already enough generations to achieve a certain position in order to achieve a certain position of the clan.
Richard's father wasn't one of them.
After a brief study in primary school, he was working for a diner, and later, a free man who paid his fines, he tried to fry the pumpkin.
He was also organised socially, and Margaret Biggs came from a prosperous peasant family from Bedminster, and brought together, among other things, reading literacy, even though he did not understand.
Children, the first girl, you came to the weather with an adequate frequency, so that some of them suffer unbearable pain and grief.
If Dick learned to rule so much to pull out before ejaculating, the number of children stayed with two living sons and three girls.
A family, and a little small enough to take care of it.
Dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read as well as to write, and his hopes focused on Richard when it became clear that two years younger William's schoolboy.
So if Richard was seven years old, he was the one with Colston Poisson School and became a famous blue coat that proclaimed the bristolans that his father was poor, but his father is honorable.
And in the subsequent five years, he was stamped with literacy and numeracy.
He learned a handsome hand to write, to calculate, nervous himself through Caesar's wars, Cicero calls and the Ovidius Metamorphosis, the helpless sausages.
Because he was a good student, even though he was far from distinguished, and he had a decent stamp of silence, he got away with a lost Mister Colston's charity teacher, and more profits than many others.
At the age of 12, it was time to leave school and to find a business or an inviting business.
However, as a great surprise to relatives, he did not choose any of the existing activities of the bodies.
His biggest forgiveness turned out to be mechanics, assembly of things, and it was an admirable patience for young man.
And on his own choice, he became a master at Master Tomas Habitat, who held a weapon of arms.
My father had a decision on a quiet joy, he was sentencing that one of Morgan's grows is a handcraftsman.
Besides, the war was part of life and the war needed guns.
The man who made weapons and repaired the weapons didn't threaten a threat to the battlefield.
For Richarďs, seven years of apprenticeships were happy working hours and learning time, even though it was a little modest for physical pleasure.
Like the other boys, he worked for a man's house, served him at the dinner table, filled the stomach with food, and slept on the floor.
Fortunately, Lord Tomas Habitas was a good host and even better the gun.
Although he was able to prepare the beautiful duel pistols and hunting shotguns, he had enough to understand that they had to be in Manton, but Manton couldn't be in Manton.
This was the case for his work in military musculoskeletal 46-dusty beauties called "Pruun Bessie", and still peanut brown hair.
At the age of 19, Richard received a masterpiece and moved out of the Habitat household, but not his workshop.
He continued to work on the Pruuns Besside.
And he married, when the apprenticeships were resigned.
The wife of her mother was his mother's daughter, but that the English church had no objection to this, his girlfriend at the altar of the bride James James.
Marriage was arranged, but there was a lot of love between the spouses running over the years.
Although there was some confusion about the son of Richard Morgan and Margaret Briggs, Richard Morgan, the son of Margaret Briggs was a woman.
Until the Habitas Armed Army worked, there was nothing weird because the young couple lived in a repent rental apartment at Avle Street, Habitas from the Habitat and Jewish synagogue.
The marriage was signed in 1767, three years after the end of the seven-year war with France; despite the victory in debt, Britain was forced to increase revenue to increase revenue, and to dramatically tighten the money.
There were no more weapons left, so the masters and students at the Habitat, until the entire company consisted of Richard and Lord Tomas Habitas himself.
And then, for a while after a little Mary was born in 1770, Habitas was reluctant to let Richard be shot.
"come to work," Dick Morgan has kindly called.
"The weapons come and go, but the rum remains."
And that's what happened, despite the problem.
Richard's mother was always invited briefly to Mag and Richard's wife Peg, both of Margaret.
The bigger problem, however, was that all men in England, except for the progeny of the opponents, who were crossed into Cranfields and Onesiphorus were either John, William, Henry, Richarďs, James, James, or Thomas.
It was one of the few practices that fit all the king's beaches.
"This is the first time I see this."
It was called a diver in a caliber who was just soaked in the stern of the research ship, and barely got word from the mouth.
After the ladder has swallowed, he took the leak and the mask and passed them to the waiting ferry.
Then he dragged himself out of the water, losing a balance on the surface of the cylinders for a moment, but landed from the above, alive and alive.
In a moment, there was a fragmented shape surrounded by other crew members who were already waiting on the dive deck.
Jack Howard stepped down from the captain and smiled a friend.
He still couldn't believe that this bodyman could move so much from the water underwater.
In the back on deck, the diving gear in the back of the deck opened up in his mouth, a friend of the year with a lovely year in the year.
"and we thought you were swimming back to Athens and sitting in the gin and tonic with your father's pool."
The study is not based on solid qualitative data, forecasts or personal opinions, but has been assembled from many sources, including interviews, arrogance, trends and hearing.
All data prior to 1990 are based on interviews and online search for numerous newspapers, television and radio newspapers – specifically searching for information collection methods used earlier.
The schedule for the period after 1998 is based on everything that has taken place over the last 11 years and I have read about 1000 different studies.
The schedule for 2009 and the following years is based on the forecasts of me and others for the years ahead.
The graphs are not prerequisites for 100% accuracy, their aim is to outline the evolution of the situation and to outline the social media news, targeted communication and other such future.
The article aims to make people think.
We are now seeing a completely novel way of communicating people - that makes traditional ways simpler.
This is a fundamental change that makes the world, which we feel, completely.
The best thing about this is that you can help with this.
Come with me to the last 210-year of information sources, plus a blink to the next ten years.
Before we start exploring the future, we'll see how we made it to the day we go back to 1800.
In the 1800s, people came out to talk to people and meet them.
Everything was face-to-face communication.
For the sale of the product, you should have been to the local market and the only possibility to communicate with the general public was to meet personal or set up a sales table.
It meant for you that it had to be in the right place in order to obtain information or to give it.
You didn't know what was going on in another part of the city, and couldn't sell your products to the people in another place.
They were told about a novel concept called newspaper...
By 1900, newspapers and magazines have changed communication, enabling us to get news of where we were never.
We got our ideas to people we never saw, and sell our products to others who were far away.
We were supposed to go out and talk to other people, but we got to be aware of our own town.
It was unbelievable, the first real revolution.
The world started to open.
Since 1920, the new source of people's attention - the radio.
Suddenly, the voice of another person has been heard from hundreds of miles.
But most importantly, the latest information was possible in real time.
It was the next huge development in history.
However, the radio development time meant that until 1960, the newspapers dominated the newspapers.
If you wanted to get the latest news or introduce your product, you'd have used the newspaper.
It seemed to be a very large source of information.
This situation started to change in 1960.
The radio reached and two main sources of information had been transmitted in real time news on radio and newspapers and magazines.
It was a great time for the media, although some said that the newspapers would be able to compete with the radio, the argument that we could have heard the next 50 years.
Over the next 40 years, the next technology revolution was introduced.
It started to collect public interest in the 1950s and the beginning of the 1990s was a big, vanquished newspaper and magazines, but yet dominated by radio.
Now people get information as well as watching.
The years 1970s were also time when publishers of newspapers realized that something was horribly wrong with their sales market.
They had a lot of problems with the radio race, but television was another class.
Only eight years later and television was dominated by the information world, the radio was almost just a place to hear free music and the newspapers did everything that could be able to survive.
The constant development of technology continued with persistence, never seen before.
The new phenomenon was spelled in the shadow: the Internet.
1998 was the year when the Internet changed from a strange place, which had not much significance, arguing that it would be undisputed that every company must have a website.
The revolution has started three years earlier, but in 1998 it reached critical mass and tried to draw attention to all the attention, despite the relatively low and most people being deprived of access.
However, all that it was the future - the start of a new era.
It was a place where everyone could have information everywhere - at least theory.
People started to realize the Internet was more than just information.
When you joined the conversation, you got something back and being part of it instead of being a monitor.
However, the most important thing was to choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it.
Internet opportunities were irreversible.
In 2004, only six years later, the Internet had changed the way we were content.
However, television and newspapers dominated our news sources, but the newest world was definitely on the Internet.
People made new websites and discovered the world of online applications.
People were able to do so much and participate in so many areas in order to show a new concept: the overload of information.
For the first time in my life, we were in contact with more information than we were able to absorb.
In the newspapers, we had to choose what we wanted to see.
In 2004 we had to choose what we did not want to see.
It had a disastrous impact on the traditional image of the information.
In the past, it was possible to get people's attention simply by doing something.
People wanted more choice, so they just had to give them a new option.
In 2004, it changed because it was not enough to do something different: it had to be better.
2004 was also a year when another phenomenon began to emerge: social networks.
This concept was quietly collected by blogs.
It was easy for everyone, easy and accessible to share our ideas.
For the first time, everyone had a chance to create their own own information, without doing anything technical.
The handling of information became a tool tool for all tools.
Three years later and the social element of the Internet, when the voice of the powerful people actually is.
For the first time, television was no longer the main source of information and the newspapers fought for survival.
Everyone wanted to create a little world and connect it to his friends.
2007 was also a turning point for traditional websites that people compared with newspapers - in static and passive form.
We wanted an active information.
We wanted to be part of this, not just to look at it.
Blogs started to get into trouble.
As television has eliminated the radio (because it was better and more richer for people to provide information on the radar), the social networks removed the blogs.
The social profile is more active for people to share what they care about.
Social networks are just better for this and blogs can't stay behind it.
Two years later, today, the new Internet is dominating our world.
Newspapers are dead in water and people are watching less television than ever.
We are the new kings, using the tools of social networks to contact and communicate.
Even a traditional website will die, which has been killed by a continuous flow of information from the social networks.
Over the last 210 years we have seen amazing development how we can get information.
The main steps are:
Getting out of the remote places.
It's getting in real time.
3, seeing it in real time.
4. decision to look at something and watch.
5.
6.
Being a source of information.
2009 is the beginning of the next revolution.
All we know is changing.
The first and most dramatic change is the concept of social news.
It will quickly take over our need to know what happens in the world.
The news will no longer be transmitted by journalists, because now it comes from everyone.
They will be transmitted directly from the source, leaving traditional media.
Instead of the journalist, what analysts say, you hear that from the analyst.
The social news will get news from the source straight and uncensored.
A new entertainment wave is emerging (light blue and purple areas) dominated by games, video and sound flows.
Instead of playing a TV channel, you decide what you want to look at and when you want to watch it.
We no longer join the channels where someone else decides what we can look at.
You're checking all the experience.
In the form of information, the new concept is slowly rising.
We already see a growing number of mobile phone services that provide local information on this area where you are located.
For example, instead of showing all the restaurants in the world, the phone only shows the list in your area.
It's something that will explode in the next few years.
In the world where we have access to more information than we can consume, it is very important that the relevant information be obtained, while extending much further to simple location, which we see today.
Over the next five or ten years, the information world will change.
All traditional forms will eventually die.
Printed newspapers no longer exist, television in the form of current channels replaced by individual programmes that you can look at when you want.
Radio broadcasts are intended to replace the pockets and video broadcasts.
Websites have a much smaller role - their primary function is to be a distributor of activities that can be done elsewhere, becoming a place where people can use raw materials elsewhere.
Many websites and communication networks join one.
Social news, as described above, is the way in which people interact.
The traditional press will be fully replaced, as people receive information directly from the source.
Everyone is a potential reporter, but the new advantages of the use of target groups will eliminate most of the poison.
Journalists become editors who instead of communicating the news will bring together a larger picture of us.
The future news flow is personalised and it's constantly changing according to what you're looking at, the same way Last.fm does music today.
All form the target group.
You have control over each individual information that moves towards you.
Two new concepts are emerging in 2010.
One of them is intelligent information where information flows can involve parts of different sources of news, not just pulling data, but by bringing it together, sharing it by dividing it and issuing valuable parts.
Instead of reading the five different articles of the same subject, you will be given one, highlighting important interest points.
How secure are your Christmas lights?
The EU tests show serious risks to the electric shock and fire resistance.
Stay safe, turn them off when you go to bed or exit the house.
The market investigation carried out by the Commission has pointed out that each set of Christmas lights had direct fire safety or electroshock risk.
The tests were carried out in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia with nearly 200 sheep sets of all price categories.
Samples were checked over 20 requirements and many fell through more than one test.
The Commission found a large number of lambs, weaknesses and poor insulation in many sheep.
Only 40% of samples were made in China.
In Hungary, almost 96% of the lamps are dangerous.
In the Netherlands, 56% did not reply to EU security standards.
Although only five countries took part in the study, it is likely that the same lamps are sold across the EU.
The Commissioner for Consumer Protection Maglena Kuneva said that the results were waking up.
He urged EU Member States to work better on security requirements and said that industry (producers, retailers, retailers and importers) should also make control more effective.
For customers, he stressed vigilance by proposing the following:
In Stockholm, some 4 000 participants are expected to take part in the Stockholm event, which will be presented to the EU's efforts to make development more effective.
The general theme "citizens and development" will focus on the impact of this year on the economic downturn in global warming and poorer countries.
Although they are usually the last ones to blame, these countries are particularly affected by both economic downturn and climate change.
Rising levels of sea level, desertification and increased frequency and more serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and unprecedented development goals.
And the current economic climate has led to a reduction in assisting donations for developing countries, reducing food guarantees in the already vulnerable regions.
In bringing together politicians, public officials, NGOs, business leaders, academics, academics and media, the European Development Days offer the opportunity to establish relations, sharing experiences and find new partners for development projects.
Three days, which starts on 22 October, includes training, discussion platforms and workshops.
"The development village" offers organisations the opportunity to present themselves to the delegates and to the public and to raise awareness of their objectives.
A number of development prizes are shared, including the Lorenzo Natali Prize for Human Rights, for the outstanding presentation of human rights, democracy and development challenges.
The youth development premium goes for teenagers or videos that show human development in Africa.
On October, the EU will also make the first European progress report on the matter.
This represents the discussion of the dispatch on the EU approach to the EU's approach to sub-Saharan Africa.
The EU will provide more than half of all development aid.
The donors' conference will send strong signals to support Georgia.
Until later, Georgia was the fastest growing economy in the world in Georgia, 12% in 2007.
This change in the short, but intense conflict with Russia in August.
Key transport lines and utilities were damaged, buildings and houses turned into rock bubbles and bombs destroyed large forest areas.
More than two months later, many foreign investors have left, tourists have disappeared, unemployment has risen and many georgians have emptied their bank accounts.
The World Bank now predicts that Georgia, the gate of energy sources to Europe needs EUR 2.4 billion to recover.
Over the next three years, the EU has committed EUR 500 million and the US has promised EUR 757 million (1 billion dollars) over half of this year.
The EU and the World Bank hosted the donors' conference on 22 October to meet the remaining EUR 1.1 billion.
The event was invited to nearly 70 countries and the institution.
The aid will support reconstruction and help the Georgian Government to meet the first needs of those people who had to flee their homes.
Tens of thousands of people were resettled, many of them still find shelter in temporary refugee centres.
But the longer-term objective is to restore the Georgia economy, which has been undergoing major changes in recent years.
"It is important that the crisis does not lead Georgia to political and economic reforms, which are now more important than the summer of the conflict" said Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
The former Soviet Republic will normally receive around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union.
Between Georgia and Russia, there are differences between South Ossetia and Abkhazia - two broke the Georgian province, which Russia recognises as independent countries.
The first peace talks in Geneva on 15 October and talks will continue under the auspices of the UN and the European mediators in November.
It allowed EU observers to move to the ceasefire to monitor the ceasefire.
Thousands of Russian soldiers remain in separatist areas.
The European musicians were honoured for a well-selling debut.
Ten new stars share the spotlight on this year's European Border Breakers Awards.
While acknowledging the success of the wider audience, European Awards are prizes for musicians whose bubbles are well sold in the European Union (except their country).
The winners of this year are the hottest names of the European music landscape - Adele (UK), Alphabeat (Denmark), Aaron (France), Cinema Bizarre (Germany), The Dø (France), the Script Bizarre (Germany), the Script (Sweden), the Script (Sweden), the Script (Sweden), the Script (Sweden).

One of the winners of the last year was Finland's rock band at Sunrise Avenue, which was victory for the Way to Wonderland album.
Mikko Saukkonen, the campaign campaign campaign for Bonnier Amigo, said that the prize is a group that is currently recording a second album.
"We are very certain that this will help the band in future."
The 2008 Cannes festival shows the success of EU-funded films in the world.
Fourteen film, which has partly supported the EU media programme, has been selected in 61 International Film Festival Festival.
In film festivals, EU-funded production is no longer a stranger and has seen millions of people over years.
The EU media programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of the continent through the film.
However, European film makers are facing major challenges both internationally and at home.
In the 19th May, during the Sixth European Day in Cannes, representatives of the EU will sit together with the European film ministers and with the European film ministers to discuss how to stimulate the audiovisual industry to greater international cooperation.
The aim is to expand the circulation of content into other parts of the world and to cooperate more closely with other film industries outside the EU.
Such an international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films.
The Cannes Festival of last year contained some of the film financed by the EU media programme.
And at the beginning of this year several EU films were presented (e.g. The counterfeiters and La Môme) Oscars.
14 EU funded films in Cannes 2008 were: Gomorra, Delta, La frontière de l'aube de Lorna, The Palermo Shooting, The Palermo Shooting, Sangue pazzo, Salamandra, Elève libre, Salamve libre, The Palermo Shooting, The Palermo libre, Salamandra.
At the EU-China Summit in Prague on 20 May, the main themes were climate change, financial crisis and economic relations.
The EU and China signed agreements to extend cooperation with science and technology, clean energy and small business.
Again, they reaffirmed their commitment to the project to develop technology in order to produce electricity from coal unbundling, one of the basic gas, which is the cause of global warming.
The two sides discussed the views of the international climate change debate in Copenhagen in December.
The EU recommends developing emerging economies, such as China, to limit CO2 emissions by providing financial support from developed countries.
With regard to the financial crisis, the EU and China agreed that international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic risks and on rising and emerging economies should have more say in these institutions.
In May, the two sides highlighted trade and investment as keys to economic recovery.
Two sides also discussed the human rights situation in Tibet and conflict in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Pakistan - three countries in which China has a significant impact.

In order to achieve the objective, the government has adopted a decision to reduce the company ’ s free capital requirements and registration costs, simplified tax information and accounting procedures and ensure financial support for micro-economic activities.
In its speech, Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are the driving force for the economy, contributing to the decline in unemployment, long-term development and stability.
We have already announced that on the dates 8-10 December, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis will attend the Congress of the European People's Party in Bonn, Germany.
The reform group of reforms has agreed on a joint communication that is already signed on Monday 2 November, with an evaluation of the current group's work and highlights the main tasks that must be achieved in structural reforms.
The exchange of information corresponds to the model of cooperation established by the government and non-governmental bodies representing the shared responsibility for socio-economic situation in the country, the international obligations of Latvia and their impact on future developments.
The reform group has set priorities for these tasks focusing directly on the competitiveness, growth and recovery of the country's economy.
The group stresses that the assessment of the combined key functions carried out and the rational use of potential public budgets has made progress in defining the reduction of funding according to the performance of tasks and the assessment of functions aimed at reducing linear financing.
Although agreement was reached on objectives - small and efficient administration, expansion of internal and external markets for the Latvian economy and promoting employment - shared the general opinion of the need to continue to work towards a clearer framework for future structural reforms.
The Reformiadministration Group believes that the active introduction of social security measures should be continued, measures contained in economic recovery plans aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and attracting investment, measures to support the launch of micro-economic activities and business start-ups, in-depth public administration functions, accelerating the assessment methodology, and the introduction of the principle.
The Reformiadministration Group has agreed to make the introduction of the EU programmes late, which has been delayed in the current period of five years.
The Reformiadministration group was established in July 2009 with a view to ensuring public participation in the budget reduction and decision-making.
On 26 and 27 November, the International Conference in Riga was an international conference in the European Union.
Latvia and Estonia agree jointly to rent a diplomatic mission for the territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt.
As from 1 January 2010, Latvia and Estonia are working together in the rented complex in the Arab Republic of Egypt, optimising their administrative costs.
This agreement was reached between Mr Maris Riekstins and Mr Urmas Paet, Minister for Foreign Affairs, during his official visit to Riiga on 18 February this year, and ended with the next talks between Foreign Ministers.
This initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Baltic States in the light of the Presidency-in-Office of the Baltic Council, in which Latvia is taking the same projects in the future in 2010.
The Latvian Embassy in Cairo has acted since 2007, officially opened in March 2009 during the visit of Minister Maris Riekstins to Egypt.
Since 2010, the Estonian representation in Egypt starts work on premises rented with Latvia.
Latvia is represented by Maris Self in the Arab Republic of Egypt.
Mr Maris Riekstins, Minister for Foreign Affairs, called on the Russian Foreign Minister to find a quick solution to the situation of freight carriers at the border of Latvia.
The report calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to ensure that the European Parliament is in a position to ensure that it is not in a position to comply with the provisions of this Directive.
Both foreign ministers share the view that the situation of mutual relations in this year can generally be assessed positively.
Next, ministers reviewed the agenda for the forthcoming year of EU-Russia relations, including further improvements in the legal framework, such as a number of important agreements between several governments.
Ministers also discussed the current situation on freight transport and the Russian border at the border of Latvia and Russia.
Because of the increased customs control of the Russian Federation, the situation in Latvia is dramatic and the long transport truck in Latvia is needed to get a swift solution, because it causes significant losses in the telephone conversation, Mr RIEKSTINS.
Ministers agreed that the respective institutions of both countries, including the Latvijas Road Transport Association, should continue to make efforts to normalise the situation in the near future, according to the agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Panel on Transport on 18 December.

Dear Mrs. Brown,
I am a student in DeLand High School and I consider the future career as a bank.
A family friend Dr. Randall Hansen from the University of Stetson recommended that you be willing to let me spend one day watching you, so I could know more about banking.
I know I'm asking quite a lot, but I would be extremely grateful if you would allow me to keep you quiet in half or throughout the working day if you carry out your regular duties.
If possible, it would be useful if we had a short interview at the end of the day of work so that I could ask questions that I might be able to monitor after your activities and operations.
Thank you very much for taking my request into consideration.
I'll call you in a week.
If you need to contact me before that, you can freely contact me (386-555-2922) or email (kylie5843 @ yahoo.com).
Thank you for your time and reflection.

Dear Mr or Mrs
I recently ordered a new pair of shoes (commodity code # 6542951) on your website on 21 June.
I got the order on June 26.
Unfortunately, when I opened it, I saw the shoes were used.
The shoes were all soils and a little tear was part of the front of the front toe.
My order number is AF26168156.
To solve the problem, I would like you to take over my account, which was asked for their shoes.
I've already gone and bought a new pair of shoes from the local sports store, so I'd have two pair of shoes, so I'd have two pair of shoes.
Thank you for reading this letter for time.
I've been a good customer of your company for many years and this is the first time I've encountered a problem.
If you need to contact me, you can reach me at 5555 5555.

Dear Miss Coling:
My name is Susan Harris and I'm writing for Lockwood High School students.
We would like to invite you to attend a special event that will take place at our school.
Your coming would honor us.
Please respond by Monday, 26 February, to confirm your presence.
We're hoping to see you here,
Sincerely, Susan Harris.
In 2007, the most powerful particle accelerator of the particle accelerator, CERN Hadron Collider Collider, is mostly measuring energy in the energy state, which was only moments after the Great Pauku.
By allowing them to collide when they move close to the speed of light, scientists hope to find information about the historical forms, using the energy that has been released for that impact.
What is it expected of the large investment that Europe has done to produce LHC?
It sends two proton speeds, particles formed by atomic core and belonging to the particle family, in different directions with a longer-circular underground tunnel.
In order to speed up the protons and to ensure that they are closed, strong magnetic fields are necessary, and these fields are generated by superconductors, materials capable of driving electricity without barriers or energy loss and which are produced in cooperation with European industry.
The proton collision will take place at a speed of eight decimal millions per second of an enormous energy volume of 14 TEV.
In order to understand the size of this magnitude, 1 TEV is about the amount of energy used by the flying mosquito to move.
But in the LHC, it will be concentrated in a million times smaller area than this bug.
As energy can be transferred to particles in accordance with the principle of mass energy equivalence (E = mc2), physics are expected to create particles that have never been considered in the accelerators.
The frequency and intensity of the collisions are important as they make it possible to see the particles of particles more visible.
There are two main nuclear speeds that energy candles with 1 150 Tev, but fewer collisions per second.
For search supersymmea...
Certain sensors are capable of analysing the impact.
The two names are CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and Atlas (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus).
They focus on detection of supersymmetrical particles and Higgers.
What's super symmetry?
Particle physics contains several symmetries, such as matter and antimatter.
Supersymmetry binds fermion (construction material for the matter, such as electrons and quarries) with each boss (channelled through the transfer, such as foil) and vice versa.
The challenge is that the super-symmetrical symmetry of the antiparticles has never been seen before.
How do you detect them?
Paradoxically, through their absence!
"it's a little like being a movie.
You count the number of incoming and outgoing people.
If any person is missing at the end, because you know who entered, guess who did not. ”
In the same way, LHC will know that, as a result of certain collisions, these antiparticles should arise, which are invisible to all sensors.
Knowing before the collision energy, they compare the energy of the particles after the collision.
If there are differences in energy, a part has escaped.
By calculating the missing energy, they know whether the supersymmetry component or antiparticle is involved.
The second challenge of cms and LHS detectors is the detection of the bosses of Higgins.
The focus point on the standard model theory is that it should be interface with particles and give them mass.
How?
Let's assume there's a towels of physics.
Suddenly, Albert Einstein comes in, students gather around him and start bombing her questions.
If Albert is trying to move, he'll feel a certain inertia for students stamping on him.
He's similar to those particles, the bosses of Higgs trying to interact with them - they collect mass.
Here too, the anticipated detection of their famous bosses can only be indirect: particles that arise as a result of their degradation, they are the ones discovered.
Kvargi-gluon soup
The third sensor that LHC is equipped with is called Alice (a large ion wave experiment).
It aims to detect parts of unknown nuclear physics, particularly the matter of matter, which existed within a very short time after the Great Pauku, and what known as the quarterback.
What is the new speciality?
In the 1960s, scientists realized that proton and neutralized, which formed the nuclear core of the atom, were made even more of the original particles - blocks.
These blocks are strong forces (which are directed by the particles called gluon).
One of their own is that they are diverse together: they are always either in pairs or tribes; they cannot exist alone.
The more you try to separate the Kvark from the other quarter, the greater the strength that keeps them together, making them permanent.
They say they're in prison.
However, if the protons are to be bombed against each other in large energy, the soup and the soup containing the blocks will be set up in which the quarries are free to move freely.
Then we can refer to the release of quarter-gluon soup.
What kind of release?
"This is somewhat comparable to skiing.
If there is not much snow, the tracks may be separated by grass and skiers are limited to their facility.
On the other hand, if there's a lot of snow, they can change the path.
They are free from restrictions. "
Instead of the snow, physics include energy: the higher the quarterly energy, the weaker of the power, so it can be separated from a certain level of energy.
The plasma presence of Kvargi-gluon was probably one microseconds after the Great Pauku.
This is why physicists want to investigate the ion irons created by the LHC.
By nature, they are very rich in proton and neutron.
They can achieve energy 1 150 TEV, which is necessary for quarterly gluon plasma, which was unprecedented with precision at the beginning of the Universe.
Antimatter mystery
Finally, the last sensor called LHCb (a great Hadron accelerator).
Its task is to better monitor the small differences between mamatter and antimatter, so that better understanding of what happened to the antimatter of the universe.
For each part of the component, the antidote is the same as the same mass, but the counter-charge.
For this reason, there is a negative mass for electronic equests, but the antielectrical power (or position) corresponding to the positive loan (or positioning).
If the electrician and the antielectric power are assembled, they will destroy each other, result in energy supply.
In accordance with the standard model for particle physics, an equal quantity of matter and antimatter is created at the beginning of the universe.
Consequently, all particles should destroy each other and the universe should be empty.
However, as anyone can see, there is a lot of matter.
This is a place where this question is to be raised by the LHCb: where is antimatter?
One possible response is based on the ability of certain particles to alter themselves as their antiques and vice versa.
In this case, the existence of the matter depends on the hypothesis (awaiting proof) that the transformation of antiparticles into particles is dependent on the opposite transformation at the beginning of the universe.
Can this imbalance be demonstrated?
This is actually an experimental block with particles, which are called the athletes.
The Anticaons are spontaneously transformed into the onboard, but the opposite is much less frequent.
LHCb is investigating another candidate, B beekeeper, containing (among other things) an element (or an antique) which is called a B-block or decorate (where the charming name is also required).
Although the particles can't be seen, they can be detected.
For this purpose, LHC is equipped with equipment containing a number of concentric layers (such as onion) surrounded by particle speed where the impact occurs.
Every layer specializes in detecting a certain type of thing.
In the center of the sensor, there are millions of semiconductors inside that chamber that produce power pulse when a particle goes against.
These impulses are recorded by computers.
There's a magnetic field inside every sensor.
This will help detect and investigate the trajectory of particle particles (e.g. electric or proton), which are sensitive to magnetic field.
The second device is a calorific device.
Some calories stop particles like photons or electrons, but others are designed to stop neutrons and photons.
They measure the particle energy loss.
Aid from string
How to define the nature of the algoparticles in isolation from mechanisms leading to their creation?
Apart from the standard model of the particle physics (resulting in quantum mechanical mechanical postulates), modern science has concentrated its hopes entirely on a new acquiring concept that would offer a high level of mathematical theory.
It extends the prospects to a completely new experiment in the CERN.
The standard model (the cornerstone of modern physics used in the 20th century in the 20th century) must contain elements that are controlled by the three particles between particles and the strong and weak power.
This will allow us to provide descriptions that fit very well with what is going on in this endlessly small world.
However, this model does not take into account the fourth interaction - gravity.
Now, quantum physics, when the light presents itself with a particle, on the footprint, the gravity of the gravity must be transferred to another particle, graviton.
Search for harmonisation
This is why there is an obstacle (see boxing) on the basis of a standard model model.
In addition, the Universe was very extreme as well as extreme mass (all energy and matter was concentrated in a very small area).
Consequently, the theory also describes the particles that predominately dominated this period.
So how do you connect all this general theory of relativity to the Einstein at the beginning of the last century, which turns completely around gravity?
"The harmonisation of quantum mechanics and general relativity has become the physical Grail of physics.
Scientists are working on this problem.
The most promising way seems to be a string theory. "
Points to string
What does this theory tell us about the world?
First, the particles will look not as bunkles, but if the elements can be compared with the extremely small string, which is a 10-35 metres long (to a number of 1 to 35, the first of them is on the left).
These strings vibrate and the nature of their vibrations match the different types of particles.
The more string vibrates, the greater the energy amount of the corresponding part.
One theory that is necessary for this mathematical integrity is supersymmetry.
In order to understand what it is, a brief description of the "zoology" is necessary.
Kvantkehad can be divided into two families: on the one hand, there are fermions where electrons and blocks are covered by electrons, the other side of the Bosnian family, which includes the main features of the field of the electromagnetic power, and graviton (mentioned above) for gravity.
Supersymmetrics problem
Supersymmetry consists of a premise that each part of the fermion family corresponds to a part of the family's family and vice versa, so symmetrical.
The supersymmetrical part has not yet been detected, but physicists of particles are expected to have a high energy impact in collisions that they will soon create using LHC, the new CERN particle accelerator.
In the meantime, astronomers may indirectly monitor the effects of mysterious particles because the total mass of galaxy and galaxies appears to be much higher than the luminous mass (stars, gases, etc.) which have been detected in the telescopes of the astronomers.
They therefore possess the presence of invisible black mass, which is interchangeable with other matter only through this gravity, and contains very stable, so also very mild particles.
There are a number of key features that the simplest particles of supersymmetry share.
They may therefore be unfamiliar with the black mass components, the phenomenon for the first time examined by the Swiss astronomy Fritz Zwicky in 1933.
Four interactions with one single interaction
The second question, which is problematic for researchers, concerns the four fundamental fundamentals of nature.
Why are their strengths so different from each other?
For example, the strength of gravity reciprocity is much weaker than the electromagnetic interaction.
As proof of this, the magnetic field is sufficient to attract relatively large metal mass, while the entire planet is required to move the same mass.
One question that this question is is that all the fundamental interactions are only one of the most important interfaces with the enormous energy wholesale, which began to fall at the beginning of the Universe.
