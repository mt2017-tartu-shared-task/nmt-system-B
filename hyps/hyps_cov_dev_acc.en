the purpose of this report is to provide a description of how the function of human resources management should be established – to clarify the PH strategy and the operations .
currently , the investment compar@@ tment does not have a Ph@@ -@@ function .
the idea of this report was designed in the debate on 22 September in the EU@@ PC@@ U leader D@@ ace Ro@@ z .
however , the contents of the PH@@ U were also discussed with other entities : An@@ ita Bis@@ of@@ a , Val@@ da Ce@@ pu@@ ters and Val@@ dis Bis@@ sel .
the Mo@@ e Investment Department is growing rapidly and is facing many changes over the coming years .
possible changes in the organisation of the department are already under consideration .
the pressure to deal efficiently and correctly with the work processes as well as staff matters is in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c .
in the current situation , directors and Heads of Unit are so busy with projects so that it is not just time to develop the PH .
it is highly desirable to appoint a person responsible for the &amp; quot ; PH &amp; quot ; option to focus on the establishment of a system of staff management and be able to develop it in accordance with practical needs .
before planning an investment department , the department &apos;s vision and mission must be clear .
the strategy for the Investment Division and the short-term action plan shall be reviewed once a year .
the participation of the EU , but also in national programmes , should be highlighted according to the actual need .
the number of projects will increase significantly and more and more projects will reach an operational phase that affects the number of necessary staff and their areas of competence .
the PR@@ K will soon be ready ( manual of implementation of the project ) and the P@@ K@@ J ( project management manual ) .
they should be able to use them this au@@ tumn .
the PR@@ K shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the appropriate sub-@@ processes .
these guidelines provide practical indicators for both the work@@ flow and the organisation .
these guidelines should serve as a basis for the following steps , such as the writing and the identification of the areas of competence .
the measures necessary for the establishment of the staff management system and in the development of a future practical need shall be described in Annex III .
the initial scheme for the establishment of the PH@@ S is set out in Annex IV .
the plan would be the assu@@ mption that the staff manager / coordin@@ ator will be able to work full-@@ time work at the beginning of December 2003 .
the Director of the Department and the Heads of Unit should cooperate closely with staff management staff — to inform him of the needs of the continuous development and to place it at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t .
they will also be responsible for the evaluation and the sco@@ reboard for the development of development ; the staff management staff member will contribute to the discussion of the modernisation of ch@@ ess and data files .
the Heads of Unit must also play an active role in developing areas of competence and content .
all personnel are involved in the self-@@ assessment of competences .
staff management staff shall coordinate the evaluation of competences and manage the data files .
the budget of the Section for the financial year 2004 must cover both &amp; quot ; PH &amp; quot ; development costs ( mainly the cost of salaries , the cost of salaries of units , IT staff , IT staff ) and the cost of training .
the implementation costs consist of direct costs ( e.g. courses , le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs , materials ) , teaching and training time , training of participants in training and training and facilitation of training by the PH@@ -@@ employee .
once a year , the cost of lost time will also result in cost assessments and PL@@ P conver@@ sa@@ tions .
before the offer of any budget is offered , an approxima@@ te assessment of the training activities in 2004 must be carried out .
this law regula@@ tes the energy industry as an economic infrastructure covering the acquisition and use of energy resources and the production , purchase , conversion , storage , transfer , distribution and supply of different energy types to energy consumers and energy resources , however , the transfer procedures for the energy industry and the organisational principles and development of activities of energy supply traders are also written .
energy policy is part of the national economic policy and the Lat@@ vian National Energy Programme should be defined as the implementation strategy that is being developed for 15 years , which needs to be improved regularly – every five years – based on research and national economies , also international factors affecting the energy industry and energy supply .

in view of the call for the March 2005 Council of March 2005 , Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for the years 2005-@@ 2008 ( the &amp; quot ; programme &amp; quot ; ) , with a view to promoting economic growth and employment in the country .
the programme is a policy planning instrument , which shows how Latvia will achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for the period 2005-@@ 2008 , following the integrated guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005 .
the programme reflects the key challenges of Latvia to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and will show the main features of actions and actions to address these challenges , as well as performance indicators for achieving these objectives .
the programme shall be based on the planning documents of the approved policy of the Republic of Latvia .
the development of the programme helped coordinate the Lisbon Strategy .
the consultation was held with the Lat@@ vian Parliament and the social partners .
the programme consists of an introduction , a key part ( macroeconomic policy , micro@@ economic reforms , guidelines for employment policy ) and the annexes .
all available information and figures were obtained from the Lat@@ vian Statis@@ tical Office or Eurostat , with the exception of those specifically indicated .
in order to achieve the success of these objectives , Minis@@ tries to develop strategic plans for the preparation of the 2007 budget should be prepared on the basis of strategic planning principles , in line with the priorities set by the government in the institutions &apos; strategy for the medium-term development objectives and direction , but also all the relevant minis@@ tries , programmes and sub-@@ programmes relating to these objectives and guidelines , including their funding .
to ensure that Latvia is successful in joining the euro area ,
the Council of Ministers adopted a decision on 21 July 2005 to set up a joint European currency in Latvia to establish a plan to develop the necessary measures to ensure Latvia ’ s successful accession to the euro area .
on 31 December 2004 , public debt amoun@@ ted to 9@@ 75 million to 13@@ ,@@ 3 % of GDP .
it is expected that public debt is expected to increase further in the coming years and may reach 13.@@ 6 % of GDP in 2008 .
Latvia ’ s public debt is one of the lowest in the European Union and it is expected that it will considerably lower the national gross debt criterion ( 60 % of GDP ) , as defined in the Maas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty .
on the basis of the information provided , in the current situation of Latvia , the urgent need to develop a specific plan to reduce public debt , but before any action in the area of public debt management needs to be carefully analysed in order to ensure the most favourable transaction for the State .
the main measures proposed in the field of sovereign debt for the period 2005-@@ 2008 ( Guideline 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary resources to finance the government deficit and to re@@ finance public debt obligations at the lowest possible and favourable conditions , by limiting the financial risks and taking into account the evolution of the capital market in Latvia and all financial systems ( responsible authority : Ministry of Finance ) :
– to develop new debt re@@ purchase and debt exchange programmes to manage debt re@@ financing risk , with a view to the use of the opportunities offered by the capital market to attract long-term resources at low cost ;
- Fol@@ lowing the reduction already started in the public debt service costs , all existing provisions in the field of external credit agreements will be reviewed to assess the future of several loans in the future by re@@ financing these loans with other more favourable loans , or a possible loan contract provisions . the possibilities of amending and existing restrictions .
the sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed posi@@ tively and is characterised by relatively low public debt , but also adequate budgetary discipline .
Latvia &apos;s commitment to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact , as well as with the aim of meeting the euro area , is one of the additional positive trends in the current budgetary position .
the long-term horiz@@ on has an impact on the sustainability of public finances , mainly by the ageing population , leading to a shrin@@ king of the population and their share of the population and increasing the demographic burden .
the preliminary calculations of fiscal sustainability show that the ageing of the population is affecting the Lat@@ vian society and the public economy and monetary finances , but this effect does not result in un@@ sur@@ moun@@ table consequences .
Latvia ’ s low public debt and the pressures of increasing costs will give the government a degree of flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances .
it should be noted , however , that an ageing population has a new approach to the health care system .
the distribution of health costs by age groups clearly shows that higher costs are lower for older people , with a significant increase in the number of older people over the next 50 years .
long-term care costs are currently relatively small in Latvia , which is due to the limited resources of both the state and local authorities , but also of the traditions and values of society .
at the same time , the health of other demographic groups must also be ensured , since the overall level of mor@@ bid@@ ity is high .
the government is developing an effective health care system based on a long-term perspective .
in order to adapt significantly to the current demographic situation , it is necessary to make changes in public finances in the future .
as demographic pressure increases in the long term , the increase in the living standards of all population groups will play a decisive role in the increased productivity growth based on labour productivity growth .
it is therefore important to ensure Latvia ’ s main wealth of wealth , in line with the requirements of the labour market , in order to create an accessible labour market for all ( see section 3 ) .
it also makes a significant contribution to the overall development of the Lat@@ vian economy as it meets the requirements of wood processing , the raw material for one of the largest exports of the Lat@@ vian industry .
the forest is also an important resource for rural development , since it provides a live@@ lihood for residents working in local regions , 150 000 forest owners and businesses involved in forestry .
part of the revenue generated by the end and use or services will be invested in the forest owner to maintain the value of the forest or to introduce continuous production .
the largest forest owners ( country , local authorities and some private forestry companies with thousands of hecta@@ res of forest areas ) can ensure a continuous production process throughout the long forest management cycle .
taking into account the composition , age , structure , previous administrative practice of the tree species , the economic situation of the rural area , but also the knowledge of forest owners , the continued use of forest production in small forest owners is significantly ham@@ pered .
due to the above circumstances , there is currently insufficient investment in the rest@@ oration of forest value in the private sector ( revenues ) ; it is therefore necessary to promote bot@@ tom@@ -up productivity ( timely and high quality renewal of forest , use of selected forest reproductive material in the forest for renewal of the forest ) . , the cultivation of young trees , in particular in specialised agencies .
while Latvia &apos;s waste management systems have been complemen@@ ted and the awareness of society &apos;s awareness of the need to reduce land@@ fill has increased , the amount of gar@@ bage generated is growing every year .
the possibilities for the processing and utilisation of the waste are insufficient , although companies receive subsidies for the collection and utilisation of waste from environmentally harmful goods and products from the Lat@@ vian environmental protection funds .
water management infrastructures ( water supply and waste water collection and treatment ) are insuffici@@ ently developed and ob@@ s@@ olete , its capacity is not economically justified , the technologies used are energy co@@ stly and does not meet all environmental requirements .
this limits the development of the activity , in particular in remote regions of the country .
access to water management infrastructure is strongly influen@@ ced by the development of u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties , public health , health and tourism industries .
Latvia needs to determine the time limit for transposition of the internal market rules , but also to ensure the coordination of national governance and trans@@ -@@ national transposition of directives at the political level .
as of 7 September 2005 , Latvia had not notified 1,@@ 3 % of the transposition of EU directives ( or 0.5 % of the total number of directives ) .
given that 99@@ ,5 % of the Directives had been trans@@ posed into Lat@@ vian nor@@ ms as of 7 September 2005 , it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective – at least 98@@ ,5 % of the directives , or a maximum of 1.5 % of the transposition deficit k .
the transposition of internal market directives and the implementation of the relevant legislation directly depends on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation .
at present , there is no effective , comprehensive database for monitoring transposition of EU legislation , which would allow the monitoring of the transposition process in several reference points within a set of reference points , and thus – in addition to other factors – slow@@ s down the transposition process of directives and the EU internal market the creation of a vi@@ bration is ham@@ pered .
the scar@@ ce staff of public administrations will reduce their capacity to ensure a qualitative and timely compliance with the Lat@@ vian legal system of the transposition process of the EU directives .
the restrictions on the freedoms of the EU &apos;s internal market were lost in most of the most deprived before Latvia &apos;s accession to the EU , but there are barriers to existing transactions .
important obstacles stem from existing authorisation requirements and time-@@ consum@@ ing administrative procedures requiring additional money and time for economic operators and are the worst affected to small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is therefore necessary to analyse the validity of the existing various licensing and other restra@@ ints with the requirements of the EU , including free professions ( lawyers , no@@ taries , accoun@@ tants , archite@@ cts , engine@@ ers and pharma@@ c@@ ists ) . the requirements and validity of restrictions to enhance competitiveness in these sectors .
for the introduction of a harmonised and harmonised competition policy , the harmonisation of the standard of competition in Latvia in 2004 , in accordance with the requirements of EU competition standards , is harmonised .
in order to prevent obstacles to cross border competition or to prevent potential distortions of competition , the Lat@@ vian Competition Authority ( R@@ CC ) started to cooperate with the European Commission and the EC@@ I Member States &apos; competition authorities .
the electricity market is gradually opening .
as of 1 July 2004 , for legal entities , a qualified free consumer status threshold for legal persons was set at 0.@@ 0 G@@ W@@ h .
therefore , only domestic suppliers can choose to choose the supplier , and the opening of the electricity market is guaranteed up to 75 % .
until now , none of the free customers have swit@@ ched the electricity supplier .
in order to stimulate competition and encourage the market entry of alternative suppliers , the fun@@ ction@@ ality and distribution functions of electricity are legally and fun@@ ction@@ ally separated from the fun@@ ction@@ alities of the generation and sale of electricity .
the conditions of electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law .
the EU will build our common future and assume global commitments , using only 1 % of all its prosperity per year .
the focus of spending decisions on the challenges of today &apos;s world to our society is in the interest of the better life of EU citizens .
the European Parliament is the EU &apos;s only directly elected body .
our website on this part will find information about how Parliament is organising its work with different committees , and the work of the European Parliament is important because decisions on new European laws are jointly conducted by Parliament and the Council of Ministers , which represent the Member States in a number of policy areas .
Parliament has an active role in drawing up legislation affecting the every@@ day life of its citizens , such as environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods . .
the European Parliament is composed of 7@@ 36 members elected in the 27 Member States of the enlarged European Union .
since 19@@ 79 , MEPs have been elected direct universal suff@@ rage for five years .
each Member State shall decide which forms of elections will be held , but must respect the same democratic fundamental rules : gender equality and a secret bal@@ lot .
in all Member States , the age of 18 years is 18 years , except in Austria , where it is 16 years .
European elections are already governed by a number of common principles : direct and general elections , propor@@ tional representation and five-@@ year renewable term of office .
as a general rule , places are distributed in proportion to the population of each Member State .
each Member State has a fixed number of seats – 99 and the least 5 .
equality between men and women : the role of women in the European Parliament is growing firmly .
there are currently slightly more than one third of Parliament &apos;s members .
in Brussels , MEPs will attend meetings of the parliamentary committees and political groups in Brussels and in plenary sessions in Strasbourg .
in parallel with the main activity , they must , of course , also have time to dedi@@ cate time to their own community .
members of the European Parliament are group@@ ed together by common political views , not by nationality .
they use their mandate independently .
as the power of the Members of the European Parliament is increasing , they influence all the areas of the every@@ day lives of citizens : the environment , consumer protection , transport and education , culture , health , etc .
the new Statute of the Members of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 , the new sta@@ tute for membership of the European Parliament is more transparent and establishes the same level of remuneration for all members of the EU budget .
all Community languages are equally important in the European Parliament : all Parliament documents will be published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) and every member of the EP has the right to speak in the official language of their choice .
what better way to ensure transparency and accessibility of Parliament &apos;s work to the public ?
multilingu@@ alism firmly roo@@ ted in European agreements reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes the European institutions more accessible and transparent to ensure the success of the EU &apos;s democratic system .
the European Parliament is distingu@@ ishing between the other EU institutions on its responsibility to ensure much of the greatest possible extent .
all EU citizens must have the opportunity to consult them directly in their own language .
and since every European citizen has the right to stand for election in elections to the European Parliament , it is un@@ reasonable to ask the members of the perfect ownership of some of the common languages .
any member &apos;s right to read Parliament &apos;s documents in their own language , to follow the debate and to speak shall be explicitly laid down in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure .
in addition , the European Parliament , as the legisla@@ tor , must ensure that all legislative acts are adopted in all the official languages of the quality of linguistic quality .
in addition , the Treaty provisions allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament &apos;s work , ask questions and receive answers in their own language .
in its resolution of 9 October , the European Parliament in its resolution that &amp; quot ; Ex@@ peri@@ ence with previous European elections and refer@@ enda shows that there are more likely to be a number of people who are aware and interested in EU issues , and less informed citizens &amp; quot ; participation is less likely &amp; quot ; .
in October 2009 , the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration entitled ‘ Communic@@ ating Europe in Partnership for Communic@@ ating Europe ’ in order to under@@ line the need for political read@@ iness of all EU institutions and Member States at all levels of EU information work on the European Union .
the main objective of the joint declaration is to give citizens fair and diverse information on the EU so that they can actively contribute to the public debate on the European Union .
with the joint declaration , the EU institutions have undertaken to resolve problems with the Member States in the area of commun@@ i@@ qu@@ ation of EU issues in order to ensure communication at the level of the highest possible target group .
in this context , they expressed their willingness to develop synergies with national , regional and local authorities and civil society representatives .
while each Member State and each institution has its own communication strategy and its priorities , Parliament , the Council and the Commission agreed to establish a small number of common communication priorities for each year together .
in addition , the Commission will be invited to provide feed@@ back to the other EU institutions at the beginning of each year on the most important achievements in implementing the common communication priorities for the previous year .
the European Union was set up to end the frequent bloody w@@ ars between neighbours , the cul@@ mination of which became the Second World War .
in 19@@ 50 , the European Co@@ al and S@@ teel Community will start by comb@@ ining the economic and political integration of European countries for a certain lasting peace .
the six foun@@ ding countries are Belgium , the Netherlands , Italy , Luxembourg , France and Germany .
in the 19@@ 50@@ s , there is a cold war between the East and the West .
in Hungary , in 19@@ 56 , the So@@ vi@@ et tan@@ ks are sup@@ pressed against the prote@@ sts against the Commun@@ ist regime ; next , 19@@ 57 , the So@@ vi@@ et Union will take the space race of the So@@ vi@@ et Union when the first one is sending or@@ bit to the or@@ bit . artificial compan@@ ion S@@ pu@@ tn@@ ik@@ -1 .
in 19@@ 57 , the Treaty of Rome establishes a European Economic Community ( EEC ) or the &amp; quot ; Common market &amp; quot ; .
the 19@@ 60@@ s emer@@ ge on youth culture , the Be@@ at@@ les and the other anch@@ or@@ ages are attra@@ cting enormous teen@@ ag@@ ers everywhere , fav@@ ouring the cultural re@@ volution and the inter@@ gener@@ ational di@@ vide . .
there is good times in the economy , partly because the EU countries are fin@@ ishing customs tariffs in their deal@@ ings .
in addition , they put in place a common control of the production of food , which results in sufficient food and soon the surplus of the agricultural product .
in May 19@@ 68 in Paris , famous tur@@ bul@@ ence and &amp; quot ; the &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; from the age of 65 &amp; quot ; will later be linked to a large number of changes in society and human behaviour .
on 1 January 19@@ 73 , the number of members of the European Union will increase to nine if the accession of Ireland , Denmark and the United Kingdom will join .
a brief but violent Arab Israeli war in October 19@@ 73 brings about energy crisis and economic challenges in Europe .
Europe &apos;s most recent right@@ -@@ wing dic@@ ta@@ tor@@ ships , when in 19@@ 74 , the Sala@@ z@@ ar regime , and in 1975 , in Spain , General Fran@@ co will die in Spain .
EU regional policy will be set up to allocate gi@@ ant sums for job creation and infrastructure development in the po@@ ore@@ r regions .
the impact of the European Parliament on EU affairs is increasing and citizens for the first time in 19@@ 79 will be able to choose their members directly .
in Europe and the world , the Polish trade union , Soli@@ dar@@ no@@ ś@@ ć , and its leader L@@ ech Wal@@ es@@ a , if G@@ d@@ ans@@ k is going to stri@@ p the ship@@ buil@@ ders in the summer 1980 .
in 19@@ 81 , the EU will become a 10@@ th member of Greece , and for five years later , Spain and Portugal will join .
a single European act will be signed in 1987 .
this agreement provides the basis for a comprehensive six-@@ year programme aimed at sol@@ ving the EU &apos;s problems of cross-border free trade and thus developing a common market .
the political sho@@ w@@ point will lead to the ma@@ mp@@ h@@ ism of the Berlin W@@ all on 9 November 1989 and the resu@@ mption of the border between the East and West Germany after 28 years .
the col@@ lapse of commun@@ ism throughout Central and Eastern Europe strength@@ ens the European Neighbourhood relations .
in 1993 the creation of a single market with four fundamental freedoms is the free movement of goods , services , people and money .
two new agreements are also concluded in the 199@@ 0s : the Treaty of the European Union in 1993 , the Maas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999 .
citizens are increasingly concerned about protecting the environment , looking for new opportunities for the European Security and Defence Policy ( ES@@ DP ) .
in 1995 , the EU receives three new members , Austria , Finland and Sweden .
the Schengen Agreements , which have been named by the German small town , will gradually create the possibility for people to travel without having a passport at national borders .
millions of young people are in other countries stu@@ dying with EU support .
communication is becoming easier and more and more people are to use mobile phones and the Internet .
the euro will receive the euro as a new currency of many Europeans .
the European political di@@ vide is declared to be defini@@ tively exceeded in 2004 , with no less than 10 new countries joining the EU .
many people believe that Europe is now in their own constitution , but it is far from easy to agree on what it should be and the debate on the future of Europe will continue .
the currency of the single currency allows for a comparison of prices directly in all the Member States which use it .
travel@@ ing between countries is easier , as no change in the cost and effort of monetary exchange .
competition with the common market without borders has helped to increase the quality and lower prices .
phone calls , Internet connection and air travel cheap .
the EU will protect consumers from defec@@ tive and un@@ stable products , irrespective of whether the goods are purchased from home or from another country .
the EU will also establish the highest standards of food safety .
EU citizens can live , work or reti@@ re in other EU countries .
temporary restrictions on the free movement of labour force in the 12 countries will be pha@@ sed out .
over two million young people have gone to EU programmes to study or training in another European country .
every student and other lear@@ ner , Erasmus , Leon@@ ardo and other cross-border partnerships , will be aware of this .
the EU does not decide what school is lear@@ nt but seeks to ensure that acquired education and professional qualifications in other EU countries are recognised without problems .
good health is an important issue for Europeans and their governments .
the EU is therefore at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of the global protection of the environment and the fight against climate change .
since pollution does not recognise borders , the EU countries have been working together for years .
it is not surpris@@ ing that the ri@@ vers and be@@ aches of Europe are clean@@ er , cars pollu@@ ting less and there are strict rules on waste management .
European hazardous waste can no longer be transported to poor countries .
there are also strict EU rules to ensure the safety of the chemical substances used by businesses and on the environment .
the EU aims to make transport , industry , agriculture and tourism in such a way that they do not destroy natural resources - in other words that development is sustainable .
in order to stop climate change , the EU Heads of State have agreed strict measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 .
energy is the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the EU long-term climate policy and the EU has set binding targets for the deployment of wind , hydro@@ - and solar energy and other clean renewable energy sources .
in addition to combating climate change , it helps to promote the economy and to secure a more stable energy supply , reducing Europe &apos;s dependence on foreign oil and gas imports .
the EU has already put in place an innovative emissions trading scheme , with which businesses consum@@ ing a lot of energy will benefit from the reduction of energy consumption and are pun@@ ished for companies crossing the prescribed boun@@ d@@ aries .
the euro ( € ) is probably one of the EU &apos;s tangible achievements .
the single currency ( as at 2009 ) is used in 16 countries with more than two thirds of the EU population .
other countries will join when their economies are ready .
all euro coins and euro coins can be used in all countries where the euro is a turnover .
the paper money is all the same , the co@@ in , however , on one side of the common design and the distingu@@ ishing sign of the country of origin on the other .
the euro is in the following countries : Austria , Belgium , Spain , the Netherlands , Ireland , Italy , Greece , Cyprus , Luxembourg , Malta , Portugal , France , Germany , Slovakia , Slovenia , Finland and the United Kingdom .
our society is fa@@ irer and more effective if we do not discrimin@@ ate against other people because of their nationality , gender , disability , race or other speci@@ fici@@ ties .
the EU therefore prohi@@ bits the right to discrimination .
already in the 19@@ 50@@ s , the first EU agreements contained a clear rule , men and women must receive equal pay for equal work .
it was a pi@@ one@@ er for the EU in the fight against women &apos;s rights , and today , they form an integral part of the EU &apos;s policy .
in order to combat cross-border crime and terrorism , EU countries have taken steps to ensure full cooperation between police and customs officials , migration agencies and courts .
one of the practical measures is the European Ar@@ rest War@@ rant , which makes it easier for suspe@@ cts to refer to people from the country where they are arrested , the country where their actions are to be investigated and prosecu@@ ted .
EU countries also coordinate asylum policies and strengthen control at the EU &apos;s external borders .
since EU citizens have the right to live in all Member States , their rights must also be protected in all EU countries .
the governments of the Member States must ensure the same application of EU legislation and the enfor@@ ceability of each country in other Member States .
the EU has in many ways simplified cross-border legal issues such as marriage , divorce , divorce and child care and other civil disputes .
we need new skills , and all we have to do is to spend more time on learning .

the war between the EU countries is un@@ thin@@ kable today , thanks to the un@@ ity of the country in the last 50 years .
in the light of this success , the EU now aims to promote peace and stability beyond its borders .
the first and best way to avoid conflicts is to increase the world &apos;s wealth .
the EU as the world &apos;s largest trade force uses its impact on the establishment of fair rules in global trade .
the EU is trying to ensure that globalisation is also beneficial for po@@ ore@@ r countries .
today , the EU will provide more humanitarian aid and development aid as someone else .
the EU s@@ ends military and police missions into trou@@ b@@ led areas such as the Balkans .
this is a defen@@ sive part of the EU &apos;s common foreign and security policy .
the European Union is an example of how to successfully comb@@ ine the economic and political resources of democratic states in the common interest , as a model for other regions in the world .

the assembly calcu@@ la@@ tor is a device that can create an electronic settlement system ( Internet bank , telephone bank , mobile bank ) for the use of the necessary access codes .
the access code is the adjusted number of eight dig@@ its of the co@@ ding calcu@@ la@@ tor , according to which you are being identified .
the access code shall be unique and shall be set up for a specific co@@ ding calcu@@ la@@ tor , date , time and mode of use .
the number of access codes is un@@ limited .
each access code can only be made by one operation .
the calcu@@ la@@ tor ( s ) is ( see picture ) of the calcu@@ la@@ tor ( s ) .
2 . ( 2 ) is the tip of the calcu@@ la@@ tor on the calcu@@ la@@ tor .
if the co@@ ding calcu@@ la@@ tor is not swit@@ ched off , the co@@ ding calcu@@ la@@ tor shall automatically be swit@@ ched off for a period of time .
it is therefore recommended that the new access code be increased immediately prior to its use .
if the access codes are repeatedly increased , but not used ( enter ) , the co@@ di@@ la@@ tor is blo@@ cked .
for the re@@ acti@@ vation of the assembly calcu@@ la@@ tor , the K@@ raj@@ ban@@ ka information telephone must be called + 371 67@@ 09@@ 2020 .
the customer will then inform the bank of his user@@ name , pas@@ sword and co@@ de-@@ calcu@@ la@@ tor code .
in the event of the loss of an assembly calcu@@ la@@ tor , the customer shall immediately inform the ne@@ arest Kr@@ ā@@ j@@ ban@@ ka office or Kr@@ ā@@ j@@ ban@@ ka Question + 371 67@@ 09@@ 2020 .
the co@@ d card is a plastic card , which contains 35 dis@@ pos@@ able code numbers under a dit@@ ch .
the co@@ d card is one of the security tools that can be used by the Kr@@ ā@@ j@@ ban@@ ka electronic settlement systems – an online bank , telephone bank and mobile bank .
the code number is a nu@@ mber@@ ing combination of the card in the right of the map .
when using an electronic clearing system , this number shall be included in a personal interview .
the code code is a six-@@ dig@@ it code used for the verification of the transaction in an electronic settlement system .
in the interests of conveni@@ ence , several transactions can be confirmed simultaneously with one code .
we ask that the co@@ d card is valid until the last code is used .
in order to ensure that your constant access to the electronic settlement systems is guaranteed , we are asking for a new code card from some of the new Kr@@ ā@@ j@@ ban@@ ka customer service .
in the event of the loss or the@@ ft of a co@@ d card , we shall immediately inform the ne@@ arest Kr@@ ā@@ j@@ ban@@ ka customer service point or bank information telephone + 371 67@@ 09@@ 2020 .

he wasn &apos;t his father &apos;s only son , even though he was the ol@@ dest of brothers , his brother William made his business in Cu@@ c@@ ko@@ ld &apos;s C@@ loud and the greenhouse gas ... he had three sis@@ ters , all in a favourable marriage with fre@@ sh@@ men .
the bodies of the organs were found in several places in the city , but the Ric@@ har@@ d cla@@ n , who had been op@@ pressed in the past , had already lived in Wal@@ es , and had already lived enough for generations to achieve a certain position ; the more en@@ ligh@@ tened members of the cla@@ n such as ne@@ phe@@ w of ne@@ phe@@ w James owned , belon@@ ged to mer@@ chan@@ ts and a corpo@@ ration , made pneu@@ matic don@@ ations to the orp@@ han@@ s and spo@@ iled them . hope never to be may@@ or .
Richard &apos;s father wasn &apos;t one of them , but he didn &apos;t have any reason to feel a shame .
after a short study in primary school , he went to work with a din@@ er , and later , with a professional certificate , a free man who paid his fines , he tried to pursue the de@@ pu@@ ties of the de@@ pu@@ ter .
he was also organised as a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous marriage ; Marga@@ ret B@@ ig@@ gs was from a we@@ al@@ thy farm from the sources of farmers from B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , and brought about an inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ ity to read the reading skills , although he did not understand .
children , the first girl , came to the weather with sufficient frequency so that they did not cause any intole@@ rable pain and gri@@ ef .
when Dick learned to ru@@ in so much to pull out before da@@ wn , the number of children left to stay with two living son and three da@@ ugh@@ ters .
a real family , and a little enough to take care of the more .
dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read and write , and his hopes focused on Richard when it was clear that two years younger , William &apos;s scho@@ ol@@ man isn &apos;t .
so , when Richard had been seven years old , he ro@@ de to the Col@@ ston Po@@ iss@@ or Sch@@ ool and became a famous blue coat that declared b@@ ris@@ tol@@ ans that his father is poor but respe@@ c@@ table , a cli@@ ff of ang@@ li@@ ca@@ an .
and in the next five years , he was tap@@ ed full of litera@@ cy and computer skills .
he learned to write with a nice hand , calculate his mind , lo@@ us@@ y himself through Caesar &apos;s G@@ alli@@ a , C@@ ic@@ ero and O@@ vi@@ di@@ us Me@@ ta@@ mor@@ pho@@ sis , an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary s@@ cu@@ mb@@ a@@ g . and the words of the school mas@@ ters are dis@@ gu@@ ised .
because he was a good student , even though it was a long way of excellence , and a cour@@ tes@@ y of cour@@ tes@@ y of the presence of a cour@@ tes@@ y , he got away from the char@@ ity of Mr. Col@@ ston &apos;s char@@ ity tu@@ i@@ tion and greater use than a lot of others .
at the age of 10 years , it was time to leave the school and find a business or an invitation to a educational at@@ tainment .
however , the great surprise of rela@@ tives , however , has not chosen any of the existing activities of the organs .
his greatest for@@ gi@@ veness was the mechan@@ ics of the mechan@@ ics , the pieces of things , accompanied by an admi@@ rable pati@@ ence for a young man .
and on his own choice , he became the ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce of Lord To@@ mas in H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , who held an arms ser@@ vant .
the father has been happy to say the peace of mind , he was remin@@ ded that one of the Morgan@@ i@@ ons would grow as a hand@@ ler , not a mer@@ ch@@ ant .
besides , the war was a part of life and a war needed weapons .
a man who was able to make weapons and improve his mind was not threatened by a threat to the bat@@ tle@@ field .
for Ric@@ har@@ d , a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-old app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip was a happy hour of work and a learning period , even though it was slightly mo@@ dest in terms of physical ple@@ asu@@ res .
like the other scho@@ ol@@ boys , he was hired , lived in a host house , served him at the dinner table , filled with food on the stomach and slept on the floor .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , Lord To@@ mas H@@ ai@@ tas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was a good host , and even a better weapon of arms .
although he was able to produce beautiful du@@ m@@ my guns and hunting rif@@ les , he had enough to understand that Man@@ ton would have to be Man@@ ton , but Man@@ ton could not be outside London .
that &apos;s how he works for the war mus@@ kets , the soldiers of the 4@@ 6-@@ in@@ ch B@@ essi@@ m called &quot; P@@ ru@@ it B@@ essi@@ en &quot; , the cu@@ ffs of wood , the cu@@ ffs , and the pe@@ anu@@ t bro@@ wn bro@@ wn . kar@@ va .
in n@@ ine@@ teen years , Richard got a mas@@ ter@@ piece and moved out of the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s house , but not his work@@ shop .
that &apos;s where he continued to work on the P@@ ru@@ un@@ ide B@@ es@@ ses .
and she got married , so when the ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce of the ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce had turned around .
he could have her mother &apos;s brother &apos;s daughter , perhaps his own cousin , but that the English church had no objection to it , he was returning to his bri@@ de at St. James &apos;s church . .
the marriage was arran@@ ged , but it was in love with the love of the spo@@ uses in the years .
although there were some confusion about the fact that Richard Morgan and Marga@@ ret Bri@@ g@@ gs &apos; son , Richard Morgan , took her to marry Marga@@ ret Bri@@ g@@ gs .
until the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s gun shop worked hard , it wasn &apos;t something weird about it because the young couple lived in a regre@@ t@@ table ren@@ tal , Av@@ on against Temp@@ le Street , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s . you and the Je@@ wish sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue from the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue .
a marriage was signed in 17@@ 67 , three years after the end of the se@@ ven@@ -@@ year war with France , despite the heavy peace agreement , despite the gra@@ vity of the debt , to increase taxes for England and to raise taxes , and the ne@@ gle@@ ct ar@@ mies of the money . and dra@@ matically tigh@@ ten up the fleet .
there is no need for weapons , so the mas@@ ters and the students from one step outside H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , until the entire company consis@@ ted only of Richard and Lord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ as himself .
and then , for a while after the little Mary was born in 17@@ 70 , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was dis@@ coura@@ ged as he was forced to shoot Richard .
&quot; come to work for me , &quot; Dick Morgan called .
&amp; quot ; The R@@ el@@ low will come and go , but the rum remains . &amp; quot ;
and that &apos;s what happened , no matter what .
Richard &apos;s mother was always invited brief@@ ly on Ma@@ g and Richard &apos;s wife Pe@@ g , both of Marga@@ ret .
the greater problem was , however , that all of England ’ s men - except for the de@@ sc@@ end@@ ants of the ri@@ gid prote@@ st@@ ant , who were ris@@ ked to C@@ ran@@ fi@@ el@@ des and the O@@ ne@@ si@@ ph@@ or@@ us as the name of John , William , Henry , Richard , James or Thomas , all women were at the do@@ ts , Catherine , Marga@@ ret , Elizabeth , or Mar@@ y@@ d .
it was one of the few of the practices that fit to everyone , the king .
&amp; quot ; I see this for the first time . &amp; quot ;
it was called a cali@@ ber di@@ ver that had just given the surface of a research vessel to the surface , and he barely had a word of exci@@ tement .
after the lad@@ der , he took the pla@@ tes and the mask off , and delivered them to the far@@ med ste@@ ak .
he then stre@@ t@@ ched himself out of a poor water by losing the balance of the cy@@ lin@@ ders for a moment , but on the other side of the aid , the whole of the aid on the deck .
in a moment , a drop of shape was surroun@@ ded by other crew members who were already waiting on the di@@ ving deck .
Jack Howard stepped down the captain and s@@ mi@@ led a friend .
he still couldn &apos;t believe he &apos;d be able to move so much under the water .
back on the deck , the di@@ ving equipment in the back of the b@@ ells opened his mouth , a friend of mine in the years lovely .
&amp; quot ; and we thought you returned to Ath@@ ens and sitting in a gin and ton@@ ic in the pool of his father &apos;s pool . &amp; quot ;
the study is not based on cli@@ ma@@ te-@@ specific qualitative data , forecasts or personal opinions , but has been assemb@@ led from many sources , including inter@@ views , ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , trends and figures .
all data prior to the 199@@ 0s were based on inter@@ views and numerous online sear@@ ches on news@@ papers , television and radio history , more specifically in search of information collection methods .
the schedu@@ les for the period after 1998 are based on everything that has taken place over the past 11 years and for which I have been reading about 1000 different studies .
the gra@@ ph of 2009 and the next few years will be based on the forecasts of my people and others for the years ahead .
gra@@ ph@@ ics do not prec@@ lude the prec@@ ision of a hundred percent , their aim is to provide an overview of the evolution of the situation and to out@@ line social media news , targeted communication and other for@@ war@@ d-@@ looking future .
the purpose of this article is to put people in mind .
we are now seeing a whole new way of how people can communicate - one that makes the traditional ways to simple wa@@ ves .
this is a fundamental change , which makes the world that we know it , completely .
the best thing about this is that you can help with it .
come with me on tour of information sources into the last 2@@ 10-@@ year-old , plus a gli@@ mp@@ se of the next ten years .
before we get back to the future , let &apos;s see how we made it today , so let &apos;s start with us to go back to the 18@@ 00@@ s where it happened differ@@ ently .
in the 18@@ 00@@ s in the 18@@ 00@@ s , people had to go out and get together .
everything was in touch with the face .
in order to sell the product , you should have been the only way to communicate to the local market and in general terms , it was personal or to set the sales table .
it meant that for you to obtain information or to give it to it , it had to be in the right place in the right place .
you did not know what was going on in another town , and did not have any of their products to sell to the people in another place .
they were talking about a no@@ vel@@ ty concept called a news@@ paper ...
in 19@@ 00 , the news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines have changed communication , allowing us to have news of places where we never had .
we got our ideas to the people we never saw , and sell their products to others far away .
we were supposed to go out and talk to other people , but we could have been informed about leaving our town .
it was un@@ believable , the first real information re@@ volution .
the world began to make love to everyone .
since 19@@ 20 , a new source of information on people &apos;s attention - radio .
suddenly , you could listen to another person &apos;s voice from hundreds of miles away .
but most import@@ antly , the latest information was available in real time .
it was the next huge development in the history of information .
however , the time of changing the radio meant that , until 19@@ 60 , our lives were domin@@ ated by the news@@ papers .
if you wanted to get the latest news or introduce to people your product , you would have used the news@@ paper .
it seemed like they were the most important source of information much longer .
this situation started to change in 19@@ 60 .
the radio arrived and two main sources of information were reported in re@@ al-@@ time news on the radio , and the more detailed news reported through news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines .
it was a great time for the media , although some said , &apos; to enable the news@@ papers to compete with the radio , better news@@ papers &apos; - the argument that we have repeatedly heard for the next 50 years .
over the next 40 years , the following technical re@@ volution was introduced : television .
it began to gather public interest in the 19@@ 50@@ s and at the beginning of the 199@@ 0s , the spread of it was high , by large news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines , while still domin@@ ated by the radio .
now people got information to hear and look at it .
the years 197@@ 0-@@ 1990 was also the time when the news@@ paper publish@@ ers understood that something was horri@@ bly wrong with their sales market .
they had a lot of problems with a radio race , but television was again on the second grade .
only eight years later and television ruled the information world , the radio had almost changed only &amp; quot ; place from where to listen to free music &amp; quot ; and the news@@ papers did everything you could to per@@ sist .
the constant development of the technology continued with the persis@@ tence that was never seen before .
the new phen@@ o@@ men in the sp@@ y sha@@ de : the Internet .
1998 was a year when the Internet became a strange place that was not important , un@@ dispu@@ ted , with the view that each company has to have a website .
the re@@ volution had started three years earlier , but in 1998 , it reached a critical mass and tried all the attention , despite the relatively small and most people being used to access it .
however , everyone agreed that it was the future - the beginning of the new era .
it was a place where everyone could have received information from anywhere - at least in theory .
people started to understand that the Internet was more than just information .
in the inter@@ views of conversation , you could give back something back and be part of it instead of being just a tra@@ cker .
the most important thing was , however , that you could choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do so .
the Internet of the Internet was a deter@@ rent .
in 2004 , only six years later , the Internet had changed the way we had information .
television and news@@ papers , however , were domin@@ ated by our news sources , but the latest world was definitely on the Internet .
people made new websites and discovered the world of online applications .
people were able to do so much and to participate in so many areas , that a new concept emer@@ ged : the over@@ ride of the information .
for the first time in my life , we were in contact with more information when we were able to absor@@ b .
in the era of news@@ papers , we had to choose what we wanted to see .
in 2004 we had to choose what we didn &apos;t want to see .
it had a de@@ vasta@@ ting effect on the traditional shape of information .
in the past , it was possible to get people &apos;s attention simply doing something .
people wanted more choice , so they just had to give them a new option .
in 2004 this change , because it was not enough : it was supposed to be better .
2004 was also a year when another phenomenon began to emer@@ ge : communication networks .
this concept was qui@@ et@@ ly collected by blo@@ gs .
it was easy , easy and accessible to all of them to share their ideas .
for the first time , everyone had the opportunity to create their own information , without any technical experience .
the processing of information became a tool tool for all the tools .
three years later and the social element of the Internet showed how powerful the voice of people really is .
for the first time , television was no longer the source of information and the news@@ papers fought for survival .
everyone wanted to create their own little world and comb@@ ine it with their friends .
2007 was also a turning point for traditional websites that people compare with news@@ papers - static and pas@@ sive information .
we wanted an active information .
we wanted to be part of it , not only to look at it .
the blo@@ gs started to get into trouble .
as the television had removed the radio ( because it was a better and ri@@ chest way to provide information in the run@@ way to people ) , social networking blocks were blo@@ cked .
the social profile is a more active way for people to share what they care about .
social networks are just better and blo@@ gs can &apos;t stay on this one .
two years later , today , the new Internet will domin@@ ate our world .
the news@@ papers are dead in the water , and people look less TV than ever .
we &apos;re new k@@ ings , using social networking tools to contact and communicate .
even the traditional website will die , which has killed the un@@ mer@@ ci@@ less power of constant information circu@@ its coming from social networks .
in the last 210 years , we have seen an amazing development how we can get information .
the main steps are to :
it &apos;s got information from the dist@@ ant places .
two , it &apos;s getting in real time .
it &apos;s a vision in re@@ al-@@ time .
to decide when to look at anything and see what to look at .
option 5 to take part and comment .
6 . publication of your information .
7 . source of information .
2009 is the beginning of the next re@@ volution .
all we know is going to change .
the first and most dra@@ matic change is the concept of social news .
it will quickly take over us to be aware of what is happening in the world .
the news will no longer be transmitted by journalists because it is now coming from everyone .
they will be sent directly from the source , leaving between traditional media channels .
instead that the journal@@ ist will transmit what analy@@ sts say , you can hear it now from the analy@@ st .
the social news receives news from the source directly and un@@ cen@@ tered .
a new enter@@ tainment wave ( light blue and li@@ la@@ ge areas ) , domin@@ ated by games , video and sound strea@@ ms are emerging .
instead of putting on the TV channel , you decide what you want to watch and when you want to look at it .
we will no longer join the channels , where someone else decides what we can look at .
you control all the experience .
in the form of information , the new concept will emer@@ ge slowly .
we already see a growing number of mobile telep@@ hon@@ y services , which provide local information about the area in which you are located .
for example , instead of showing off all the restaur@@ ants in the world , the phone only shows the list in your region .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to grow in the next few years .
in the world where we have access to more information , if we can consu@@ me , it is a very important element of obtaining relevant information , so far beyond the simple location we are seeing today .
the information world will change in the next five or ten years .
all traditional forms die eventually .
the printed news@@ papers no longer exist , television , in the form of current channels , will be replaced by individual programmes that you can see if you want .
radio boo@@ ts are designed to replace them with po@@ ckets and vide@@ os .
websites have a much smaller role - their primary function is to be a distribu@@ tor of activities that can be done elsewhere , changing places where people can use raw materials in other places .
many of the websites and social networking sites join one .
social news , as described in advance , is becoming an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming way of how people intera@@ ct .
the traditional journal@@ ism is fully emb@@ ed@@ ded , as people get the information directly from the source .
everyone is a potential repor@@ ter , but the new advantages of using the target groups will eliminate the majority of the tox@@ in .
journalists will become ed@@ itors who , instead of broad@@ ening the news , bring them together , giving us a bigger picture .
the future news flow is person@@ alised , and it is constantly changing according to what you look at - in the same way that L@@ ast@@ .@@ f@@ m does the music today .
everyone contains a target group .
you have control of every single inf@@ ant that moves in your direction .
two new concepts will emer@@ ge in 2010 .
one of them is intelligent information in which information flows can be included in many different sources of news , not just pulling data , but by sharing it by divi@@ ding it into parts and by issuing valuable parts .
instead of reading five different articles from the same theme , one is proposed to give you one , highlighting the important points of interest .
how safe are your Christmas lights ?
the EU tests show serious risks for the electric shock and fire integrity of floo@@ d@@ gates .
keep it safe . turn them off when you go to bed or get out of the house .
the market survey carried out by the Commission was brought out that each set of Christmas lights tested in each third of the three tests had a direct risk of fire safety or electric shock .
the tests were carried out in Germany , Hungary , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia , with nearly 200 she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds of all the price categories .
the samples were checked for more than 20 requests and many failed more than one test .
the Commission found a series of ph@@ oto@@ conduc@@ tive , weak management and poor iso@@ lation on many sheep ’ s .
only over 40 % of the samples were made in China .
in Hungary , almost 96 % of the sheep were found to be dangerous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % did not meet the EU &apos;s market standards .
although only five countries took part in the study , the same lamp is likely to be sold across the EU .
the Commissioner for Consumer Protection Mag@@ len@@ a K@@ une@@ va said that the results were a@@ wa@@ k@@ ening .
he ur@@ ged the EU Member States to work better on the enforcement of security requirements and said that industry ( producers , retai@@ lers , deal@@ ers and importers ) should also make controls more effective .
in the case of customers , he stressed the vigilance by providing the following advice : 1 . buy Christmas lights from the mer@@ chan@@ t 2 , never leave the Christmas lights when you leave home or go to bed 3 . there are problems with the lights , stop using them , and return them to the store .
in the Stockholm event , some 4 000 participants are expected to take part from 1 500 organisations in which the EU ’ s efforts to make the development more efficient .
the general theme &amp; quot ; citizens and development &amp; quot ; focuses on the effects of global warming and the economic rec@@ ession of the poo@@ rest countries in this year .
although they are usually the ones who are accused , they are particularly affected by both economic decline and climate change .
the rise in sea level , de@@ serti@@ fication and increased , serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and un@@ prec@@ eden@@ ted development goals over the mil@@ lennium .
and the current economic climate has led to a reduction in aid for developing countries by reducing food guarantees in vulnerable regions .
bringing together politicians , national officials , NGOs , business leaders , acade@@ mics , acade@@ mics and media , European Development Da@@ ys offer the opportunity to create relations , share experience and find new partners for development projects .
three days of events , starting on 22 October , will include training , discussion for@@ ums and work@@ shops .
&amp; quot ; Development villa@@ ges &amp; quot ; offer organisations the opportunity to present themselves to dele@@ gates and to the general public and to raise awareness of their objectives .
a number of development pri@@ zes , including Lor@@ enzo Na@@ ta@@ li , will be distributed to the outstanding presentation of human rights , democracy and development problems .
the youth development premium goes for teen@@ ag@@ ers or vide@@ os showing human development in Africa .
the EU will also publish the first European progress report on the first time .
this is the place of departure for the EU &apos;s approach towards &amp; quot ; fra@@ gile &amp; quot ; against sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa countries .
the EU gives more than half of its total development aid .
the donors &apos; conference s@@ ends strong signals to Georgia .
until later , in Georgia , the fas@@ test growing economy in Georgia in the world was 12 % in 2007 .
this became a short , but ten@@ se conflict with Russia in August .
the key transport lines and the u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties were damaged , buildings and houses became a stone bu@@ b@@ ble , and the bom@@ bs destroyed large forest areas .
more than two months later , many foreign investors have left , the tour@@ ists have lost , unemployment has ris@@ en , and many ge@@ or@@ g@@ ans have emp@@ tied their bank accounts .
the World Bank is now forecas@@ ting that Georgia , the energy source gate to Europe , needs EUR 2.4 billion to recover .
over the next three years , the EU has committed € 500 million , and the US has committed EUR 7@@ 57 million ( $ 1 billion ) , over half the end of this year .
the EU and the World Bank ho@@ s@@ ted the donors &apos; conference on 22 October in order to meet the remaining EUR 1.1 billion .
the event was called about 70 countries and the institution .
the aid will support reconstruction and help the Georgi@@ an Government meet the first needs of these people who had to fle@@ e their homes .
tens of thousands of people re@@ settled , many of them will still find shel@@ ter in temporary refugee centres .
but the longer term goal is to restore the Georgia economy , which has made major changes in recent years .
&amp; quot ; It is important that the crisis does not lead Georgia away from the political and economic reforms , which is now more important than before the conflict , the Commissioner for External Relations , Ben@@ ita Ferre@@ ro-@@ Wald@@ ner .
the former So@@ vi@@ et Re@@ publi@@ can usually receives around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union .
there are differences between Georgia and Russia on South Os@@ se@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ haz@@ ia - two divided by the provin@@ ce of Georgia , which Russia recognises as an independent country .
two sides will have the first peace talks in Geneva on 15 October and the talks will continue in November under the aus@@ pic@@ es of the United Nations and European medi@@ ators .
this allowed EU observers to move to these areas to monitor the ce@@ ase@@ fire .
thousands of Russian soldiers have remained on the areas of separ@@ at@@ ists .
the European mus@@ ici@@ ans were awarded for the de@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous sale of the debate .
ten new stars share the ra@@ mb@@ ies of the European B@@ order B@@ rea@@ kers A@@ wards event in this year .
acknowle@@ dging success for the success of the wider audi@@ ence , European A@@ wards pri@@ zes are for mus@@ ici@@ ans whose debate is well-@@ sold in the European Union ( with the exception of their home country ) .
the win@@ ners of this year are the hot@@ test names of the European music landscap@@ e - A@@ dele ( British ) , Al@@ pha@@ beat ( Denmark ) , Aaron ( France ) , C@@ ine@@ ma Bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re ( Germany ) , The D@@ ø ( France ) , K@@ raa@@ k &amp; S@@ land ( The Netherlands ) , I@@ da Cor@@ r ( Denmark ) , Ly@@ ges Li ( Sweden ) , The S@@ cri@@ pt ( Ireland ) and The T@@ ings T@@ ings ( Britain ) .
pri@@ zes will be transferred to the Euro@@ son@@ ic No@@ order@@ sla@@ g at the evening of the opening of the music f@@ esti@@ val in G@@ ron@@ ing@@ en in the Netherlands , which will be transferred to television .

the 2008 C@@ annes F@@ esti@@ val shows the success of EU-@@ funded films in the world .
a four@@ teen film that has been partially supported by the EU Me@@ dia Programme has been selected in 61 C@@ annes International F@@ il@@ m F@@ esti@@ val .
film f@@ esti@@ vals no longer EU-@@ funded production has seen millions of people in a stran@@ ger and over the years .
the EU Me@@ dia Programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of the continent through the film .
however , European film makers are confron@@ ted with major challenges both internationally and at home .
on May 19@@ th , the sixth &amp; quot ; European Day &amp; quot ; , in C@@ annes , EU representatives are se@@ ated with European film ministers and producers to discuss how to stimulate greater international cooperation in the audiovisual industry .
the aim is to extend the circulation of content to other parts of the world and to cooperate more closely with other film industries outside the EU .
such an international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films .
the choice of the C@@ annes F@@ esti@@ val of the previous year included a single film financed by the EU Me@@ dia Programme .
and at the beginning of this year a number of films from the EU were present ( e.g. The counterfe@@ it i@@ ters and La M@@ ô@@ me ) were presented to O@@ sc@@ ars .

dear Miss Col@@ ing :
my name is Susan Harris , and I &apos;m writing about Lo@@ ck@@ wood High Sch@@ ool for students .
we &apos;d like to invite you to take part in a special event that &apos;s going on in our school .
your arrival would be hon@@ ored .
please respond at the latest by Monday 26 February to confirm your presence .
we hope to see you here ,
sin@@ ce@@ rely , Susan Harris .
in 2007 , the most powerful partic@@ le accele@@ ra@@ tor , the N@@ er Lar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der , has predominantly measured the secrets of the energy , which was only mom@@ ents after the Great P@@ au@@ ku .
in the presence of the children , the scientists expect to find information about previous forms of light on the speed of light , using the energy that has separated from the impact .
what is expected of this great investment that Europe has done to the production of L@@ H@@ C ?
it s@@ ends two pro@@ tons of pro@@ tons , partic@@ les formed by the at@@ om@@ ic core and belonging to the partic@@ le family , in different direc@@ tions , in a circle of 27 km in length below Switzerland and France .
strong magnetic fields are required by super@@ conduc@@ tors , materials that are capable of driving electricity , or energy sources . lose and work very low tempera@@ tures , produced in cooperation with the European industry .
the impact of the pro@@ tons at the speed of the eigh@@ th million per second of the vast energy mix of 14 TE@@ V .
to understand the magni@@ tude of this figure , the 1 TE@@ V is about the amount of energy that is used by a flying mo@@ squ@@ i@@ to to move .
however , in the L@@ H@@ C , this energy amount will be concentrated on a smaller area of one million times when it is a bu@@ g .
as energy can be transferred to partic@@ les according to a limited rela@@ x@@ ation principle ( E = m@@ c@@ 2 ) , physi@@ cians are expected to create partic@@ les that have never been looked at in spe@@ eds .
the frequency and intensity of col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons are important as they make the possibility of seeing partic@@ les in order to see the appearance of partic@@ les .
there are two main nuclear spe@@ eds of which are energy c@@ and@@ les with 1 150 to Te@@ V , but with fewer col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons per second .
the search for super sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cs ...
the sen@@ sors are capable of analy@@ sing the impact .
two of these names are C@@ MS ( Com@@ pac@@ t Mu@@ on Sol@@ en@@ oid ) and At@@ las ( A To@@ ro@@ ida@@ l L@@ H@@ C Ap@@ para@@ tus ) .
they &apos;re concentra@@ ting on the detection of super sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal partic@@ les and the bos@@ ons of Hig@@ g@@ s .
what &apos;s a super sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ?
the physi@@ cs physi@@ cally contain several sy@@ m@@ me@@ try , for example , as a cor@@ tex and an anti@@ ma@@ ce .
the Super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try bin@@ ds fer@@ mi@@ on ( for building material to the ground , such as e-@@ ma@@ ils and blocks ) with the bos@@ om ( channel@@ ling the transfer , such as fo@@ il ) and vice ver@@ sa .
the challenge is that the super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ( also designated in the form of the anti@@ partic@@ les ) has never been looked at before .
how to dis@@ cover them ?
par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , in their absence !
&quot; it &apos;s a little like being a movie .
you count the number and type of people entering and out .
if a person is missing at the end of the day , because you know who moved , you can guess who didn &apos;t . &amp; quot ;
in the same way , the L@@ H@@ C as@@ ser@@ ters know that these anti@@ partic@@ les , which are in@@ visible to all sen@@ sors , are likely to arise as a result of a certain degree of col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons .
before col@@ lis@@ ion energy , they compare the energy of particula@@ te matter after col@@ lis@@ ion .
if there are differences in energy , the partic@@ les have escap@@ ed .
by calculating the energy , they know whether the super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try component or the anti@@ ques are involved .
the second challenge of the c@@ ms and the L@@ HS sen@@ sors is the detection of the bos@@ ons of Hig@@ g@@ s .
in the case of a standard model model theory , it is assumed that it should be reciproc@@ ally and give them a mass .
how ?
let &apos;s assume that there &apos;s a do@@ zen physi@@ cs students .
suddenly , Albert E@@ inste@@ in comes into the room , the students re@@ conven@@ e around him , and they &apos;re going to bomb him with questions .
if Albert &apos;s trying to move , he &apos;ll feel a certain iner@@ tia on his side of the cl@@ ini@@ c students .
he &apos;s similar to these partic@@ les than the superi@@ ors of the Hig@@ g@@ s &apos; bos@@ ons to ex@@ ert their influence - they collect the mass .
here , too , the anticipated detection of these famous bos@@ ons can only be indirect : partic@@ les , which arise as a result of their degradation , are the ones that are discovered .
K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ glu@@ oni sou@@ p
the third sen@@ sor with which L@@ H@@ C is equipped will be called Alice ( Major of the I@@ onian Mo@@ del experi@@ ment ) .
the aim is to detect un@@ identified nuclear physi@@ cs , especially the sup@@ plements that were present in a very short period of time after the Great P@@ au@@ ku , and known as a quar@@ ter-@@ gu@@ p@@ lon@@ -@@ plasma name .
what is the new speci@@ fici@@ ties ?
in the &apos; 60@@ s , scientists realized that the pro@@ tons and neutr@@ alising the at@@ om of the at@@ om were even even more from the original partic@@ les - the blocks .
these blocks are linked to a strong force ( which target partic@@ les name glu@@ on@@ s ) are linked .
one of them is that they are diverse together : they are always either in pa@@ irs or in thre@@ es ; they cannot exist alone .
the more you try to extra@@ ct the K@@ var@@ k from the second quarter , the greater the co@@ he@@ sive force that keeps them together , making them permanently un@@ separ@@ able .
on the blocks , they say they &apos;re in jail .
however , if the pro@@ ton bom@@ b@@ ers are bom@@ bed against each other , a quarter and a sou@@ p containing glu@@ con@@ s , which are free to move freely .
then we can make a reference to the release of the quar@@ ks in a quar@@ ter-@@ glu@@ e sou@@ p .
why do you want to get rid of that ?
&amp; quot ; This is somewhat comparable with ski@@ ing .
if there are not much s@@ now , the run@@ ners can be separated by gras@@ s and ski@@ ers are limited to their establishment .
on the other hand , if there &apos;s a lot of s@@ now , they can change the path .
they are free from restrictions . &amp; quot ;
instead of s@@ now , physi@@ c@@ ists add energy : the greater the energy of the quarter , the weak@@ er is a co@@ he@@ sive force , so the safe at a higher level of energy can be separated .
the plasma of K@@ ron@@ gi@@ -@@ glu@@ on was likely to be a stra@@ ight@@ forward for micro@@ seconds after the Great P@@ au@@ ku .
this is the reason why physi@@ cians want to investigate it by means of an ion ir@@ radiation using L@@ H@@ C .
in their very nature , these pro@@ tons and neutr@@ ons are very rich .
they can achieve energy 1 150 TE@@ V , which is necessary to plasma levels of quar@@ gi@@ -@@ glu@@ on , which was un@@ prec@@ eden@@ ted in the beginning of the Uni@@ verse , for the purpose of establishing and investi@@ gating the Uni@@ verse .
ri@@ dd@@ les of anti@@ ma@@ iling
finally , the last sen@@ sor called L@@ HC@@ b ( big H@@ ad@@ ron &apos;s fas@@ test beauty ) .
the task is to better monitor the strange differences between the ground and the anti@@ ma@@ ce so that it can better understand what happened to the ancient universe .
for each part of the section , the anti@@ ques , which are among the same characteristics , have the same mass , but the counter@@ party .
therefore , there is a level of equal mass for electronic elec@@ tr@@ ons , but the appropriate anti@@ electrical ( or posi@@ tr@@ on ) of a positive loan .
if the power and the anti@@ power get together , they will destroy each other , and I will have the energy pressure .
according to the standard physi@@ cs standard model , the amount of the universe was created at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse .
so all partic@@ les should destroy each other , and the universe should be empty .
however , as anyone can see , there is a pain@@ ful ma@@ ke@@ up .
this is where the question that L@@ HC@@ b is trying to answer : where is it an anti@@ ma@@ ce ?
one of the possible responses is based on the ability of certain partic@@ les to make themselves known and vice ver@@ sa .
in this case , the presence of the ground depends on the hypo@@ the@@ sis ( which a@@ wa@@ its proof ) that the conversion of anti-@@ partic@@ le transformation into partic@@ les is dependent on the opposite rate of transformation at the beginning of the universe .
can there be an im@@ balance in this kind of im@@ balance ?
it &apos;s actually experi@@ mental with the quarterly partic@@ le types being called ca@@ f@@ es .
the An@@ tagon@@ ists will be spon@@ taneously spon@@ taneously , but it is much less frequent in the opposite direction .
L@@ HC@@ b is investi@@ gating the second candidate , a B mes@@ sa@@ c containing ( among other things ) elements of the element ( or the part thereof ) known as B block or dec@@ or@@ ator ( where the name of L@@ CH@@ b comes from . ) .
although the partic@@ les can &apos;t be seen , it can be detected .
for this purpose , the L@@ H@@ C shall be equipped with equipment containing a number of con@@ cen@@ tri@@ al la@@ yers ( such as oni@@ ons ) , surroun@@ ded by a partic@@ le beam where the impact is carried out .
each la@@ yer speci@@ ali@@ zes in the detection of a certain type of thing .
in the middle of the sen@@ sor , there &apos;s a chamber in the chamber , there are millions of hal@@ ls that produce an electric pul@@ se when the partic@@ les go against it .
these impul@@ ses are recorded by compu@@ ters , which makes it possible to re@@ constru@@ ct these tra@@ jec@@ tories .
there &apos;s a magnetic field inside each sen@@ sor .
this helps to detect and investigate the tra@@ jec@@ tory of the loaded partic@@ les ( e.g. power or pro@@ tons ) which are sensitive to the magnetic field .
the second equipment is the foun@@ ding sen@@ sor of the cal@@ ori@@ fic family .
some cal@@ ori@@ meters stop partic@@ les , like phot@@ ons or elec@@ tr@@ ons , but others have been designed to stop the neutr@@ ons and phot@@ ons .
they measure the energy losses that have under@@ gone them .
aid for the st@@ rings
how can the ess@@ ence of al@@ go@@ sa be defined as part of the mechanisms leading to their creation ?
apart from the physi@@ cs model model ( resulting in qu@@ an@@ tum mechan@@ ics ) , modern science has concentrated its hopes for the new acqu@@ ire@@ e , which would provide a high level of ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical stress theory .
it &apos;s an out@@ look for a completely new type of experi@@ ment in CER@@ N .
the standard model ( the cor@@ ner@@ stone of modern physi@@ cs , which was po@@ or@@ ly introduced during the 20th century ) , must be defined as the prec@@ ision of ele@@ mentary elements that led to three partic@@ les that are known to be influen@@ ced by the three partic@@ les : electro@@ magnetic ism and strong and weak . you &apos;re the power .
it allows us to provide a description that is well su@@ ited to what is happening in this end@@ less@@ ly small world .
however , this model does not take into account the gra@@ vity of gra@@ vity .
now , qu@@ an@@ tum physi@@ cs , when the light presents itself with a partic@@ le , foot@@ print , the gra@@ vity of gra@@ vity must be transferred to another partic@@ le , a gra@@ vit@@ on .
in the search for harmonisation
this is therefore an obstacle to descri@@ bing this part of a standard model ( see bo@@ x@@ ing ) .
in addition , at the beginning , the Uni@@ verse was so extreme and extra@@ ordin@@ arily massive ( all the energy and the ground was concentrated in a very small volume ) .
consequently , the theory also descri@@ bes the partic@@ les that previously domin@@ ated in this period , cannot be excluded from gra@@ vity .
how can we comb@@ ine to all this general rela@@ tivity theory ( out of E@@ inste@@ in at the beginning of the last century ) , which is re@@ vol@@ ving around gra@@ vity ?
&quot; qu@@ an@@ tum mechan@@ ics harmonisation and general rela@@ tivity theory has become the real Holy Gra@@ il of physi@@ cs . &quot;
the scientists are working on this problem .
the most promising path seems to be a scene theory . &amp; quot ;
from the point to st@@ rings
what does this theory tell us about the world ?
first of all , it is looking at partic@@ les not as points , but as the elements that can be compared with extremely small st@@ rings that are 10-@@ 35 metres long ( number 1 p@@ rece@@ ded by 35 zero , the first one on the left . ) .
these st@@ rings are vibra@@ ting and the nature of their vibra@@ tions correspond to the different types of partic@@ les .
the more st@@ ring vibra@@ tes , the greater the share of the corresponding share of energy .
one of the contin@@ uum theory , which is necessary for its ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical integrity , is a super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
to understand what this is , a brief description of the &amp; quot ; z@@ ool@@ ogy &amp; quot ; of the basic partic@@ les is necessary .
K@@ van@@ t@@ ke@@ had in the universe can be divided into two families : on the one hand there are fer@@ mi@@ ons , where electronic and quar@@ ks belong , on the other side , the bos@@ ons &apos; family , which includes partic@@ les of funda@@ men@@ tals , like the phot@@ ons that target electro@@ magnetic power , and gra@@ vit@@ on ( above ) gra@@ vity .
the problem of the super sy@@ m@@ me@@ try
the Super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try consists of a presu@@ mption that every part of the fer@@ mi@@ on family corresponds to a part of the family belonging to the boss and vice ver@@ sa , so the sy@@ m@@ me@@ try idea .
the super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal part has not yet been detected , but the physi@@ cians are rel@@ ying on their face with high energy in col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons which they will soon create using the L@@ H@@ C , a new central rate of CER@@ N . .
in the meantime , as@@ tron@@ om@@ es may indirectly monitor the effects of these my@@ o@@ car@@ dial partic@@ les , as the total mass of the g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies and the g@@ ala@@ xy sets appears to be much higher than the lumin@@ ous mass ( the letters , gases , etc . ) , there &apos;s an as@@ tron@@ om@@ y with tele@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
they therefore pos@@ se@@ ss an in@@ visible mass of black mass , which is reciproc@@ ally with other contin@@ ents only through its gra@@ vity , and contains very stable , thus very light partic@@ les .
there are a number of key features that the easi@@ est super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try partic@@ les share .
these may therefore be of unknown black mass constitu@@ ents , the phenomenon which was first examined by the Italian as@@ tron@@ om@@ ic F@@ rit@@ z Z@@ w@@ icky in 19@@ 33 .
four interactions between single interactions
the second issue , which is proble@@ matic for researchers , concerns the fundamental interaction of the four months of nature .
why are their streng@@ ths so different from each other ?
for example , the strength of gra@@ vity is much less weak@@ er than the electro@@ magnetic interaction .
the proof of this is that the magnetic field of the magnetic field is sufficient to attract a relatively large metal mass , whereas the whole planet is needed to move the same mass by means of gra@@ vity .
one question to this question is that all the fundamental interactions are only one of the inter@@ play with an extremely high energy source which started falling at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse .
business persis@@ tence is a vital business success .
and in today &apos;s inter@@ connected world , the operation of each company is vulnerable to disrup@@ tions .
some risks may break your business into days , but even four hours can be fatal in the competitive environment .
as a result of the increase in the number of risks to be affected , the &amp; quot ; insurance policy &amp; quot ; approach has become a cause of concern to the sustainability of the business of the worst case scenario .

if you think about the information on the infrastructure , in today &apos;s environment the global and global perspective needs to be thought .
access to information is critical , and this is an obligation that will not allow most of the companies to afford to be .
in the event of an out@@ dated or dec@@ lining capacity , the level of intensity is gradually increasing and the problem will shift dra@@ matically to restore information and control control .
IB@@ M storage and data services help customers to prevent such tra@@ ge@@ dies and ensure that the information is safe at any time , all the time .
IB@@ M Global Technology Services provides services products that
helping customers to obtain internal information on how their LO@@ B uses the storage assets and determine the best use of the storage media to the extent of the entire company ,
provide broad information on the structure of the arch@@ ive strategy ,
to maxi@@ mise the value of the information by reducing risks to customers &apos; businesses which emer@@ ge as a result of bad information infrastructure management .
and since the information infrastructure has to respond to each of the four key capacities to successfully manage information - access to information , storage , security and coordination - requires you to move data , then our Data Mo@@ bility S@@ olu@@ tions is precisely for doing so .
we are going into the details of the data mig@@ rating to make sure that we reduce the risks of the client to the leading task force in every business objective , helping the company to reduce the complexity of IT and reduce costs .
in the process of a pro@@ active approach to the media and the environment , it will benefit from the advantages that arise from the effective infrastructure of being stored .
you can give business users access to data , by giving key decision-@@ makers the information they need to up@@ grade and raise profits .
it will be cost-@@ efficient to provide storage capacity that respon@@ ds to the current needs , while creating a strong foundation for the future .
you can also better manage business risks and support regulatory compliance .
