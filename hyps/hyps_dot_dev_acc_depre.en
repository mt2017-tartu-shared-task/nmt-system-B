The purpose of this report is to describe the steps to be taken to build a staff management function – to clarify the PH strategy and operations.
Currently, the investment department is not a Ph-function.
The idea of this report was set out in the debate on the leader of the EUPCU leader Dace Roz.
The contents of the PHS plan were also discussed with other entities: Anita Bisofa, Valda Cepuriers and Valdis Bisters.
Moe's investment department is growing rapidly and faces many changes in the coming years.
Possible changes in the organisation's organisation are already in consideration.
The pressure to deal effectively and correctly with both working processes and staff matters is urgent.
In the current situation, directors and managers of entities are so busy with projects so that it is not simply time for the development of PH.
It is highly recommended to appoint a person responsible for the PH, which could focus on the establishment of the staff management system and would be able to further develop it in accordance with practical needs.
Prior to the investment department PH, the vision and mission of the department must be clear.
The Investment Department strategy and the short-term action plan are recommended to review a yearly review.
The participation of the EU, but also in national programmes, should be highlighted in line with the real need.
The number of projects will increase significantly and more projects will reach the implementation phase, which affects the number of workers needed and their competences.
Soon, the PRK (Handbook on implementation of the project) and PKJ (project organisation) will soon be finalised.
They should be used in this autumn.
The PRK shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the relevant sub-processes.
These guidelines provide practical guidance on both workflow and organisation.
These guidelines should serve as a basis for the following steps such as writing and identifying the fields of competence.
The measures necessary for the development and future practical development of the staff management system are described in Annex III.
The initial plan for the establishment of the PHS system is set out in Annex IV.
The plan is a prerequisite for the staff manager / coordinator to start full-time work on a PH development in early December 2003.
The Director of the Department and Heads of Unit should cooperate closely with the staff management staff, inform him of the needs of continuous development and to prioritise it.
They are also responsible for the evaluation of development and the scoreboard; staff management staff contribute to the modernisation and storage of templates.
The Heads of Unit must also play an active role in developing areas of competence and content.
The self-evaluation of competences involves all staff.
Staff management staff shall coordinate the assessment of competences and manage data files.
The draft budget for the 2004 budget must include both the cost of PH development costs (mainly the PHS, the staff of the units, IT staff) and the operational costs of training.
The cost of implementation consists of direct costs (e.g. courses, lecturers, materials), time for teaching and training, training for training participants and training and facilitation of the training and facilitation of the PHS staff.
Once a year, due to lost working time, the cost and PLP interviews will also occur.
Prior to the supply of any budget calculation, an indicative assessment of the 2004 training activities is required.

In view of the call of the March 2005 Council meeting, Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for 2005-2008 (the "programme") with a view to promoting the country's growth and employment.
The programme is a policy planning document which shows how the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy 2005-2008 will achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the years 2005-2008 following the integrated guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005.
The programme reflects the main problems of Latvia in achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and demonstrates the main features of these challenges and activities, but also the performance indicators for achieving these objectives.
The programme is based on the policy planning documents approved by the Republic of Latvia.
The development of the programme helped to coordinate the Lisbon Strategy Council.
The consultation was held with the European Parliament and the social partners.
The programme consists of an introduction, a key part (macroeconomic policy, microeconomic reforms, guidelines for employment policy) and annexes.
All numerical information and figures were obtained from the statistical office of the Republic of Latvia or Eurostat, except in cases specifically indicated.
In order to achieve the successful achievement of these objectives, ministries will take into account the development of strategic plans in order to prepare the 2007 budget based on the principles of strategic planning, in line with the priorities set by the government, and, as well as all relevant ministries, programmes and sub-programmes related to the specific ministries, including their funding.
To ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area,
Adopted the Ministerial Office on 21 July 2005 to establish a European single currency in Latvia with the task of the Commission to develop the necessary action plan to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area.
On 31 December 2004, the public debt amounted to DEM 975 million, or 13,3% of GDP.
Public debt is expected to increase gradually in the coming years and may reach 13.6% of GDP in 2008.
Latvia's public debt is one of the smallest in the European Union, and it is expected that it will remain significantly below the country gross debt criterion (60% of GDP), as defined in the Maastricht Treaty.
On the basis of the information provided, Latvia is not required to develop a specific plan to reduce sovereign debt, but before any measures in the area of public debt management have to be carefully analysed, possible risks should be analysed to ensure that the country is most favoured.
The main proposed measures in the area of public debt 2005-2008 (Guideline 2).
To ensure the necessary resources to finance the deficit and refinancing public debt obligations at the lowest possible cost and as favourable conditions as possible, limiting financial risks and taking into account the development of the Latvian State capital market and all financial systems (responsible authority: Ministry of Finance):
– to develop new debt refinancing programmes and debt exchange programmes to manage debt refinancing risks in order to use the opportunities offered by the capital market to attract long term resources;
- The reduction already started by the State's external debt service is reviewed by all existing provisions of external loans to assess the future repayment of multiple loans – refinancing loans for other more favourable loans – or possible changes to the provisions of the loan agreement.
The sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed positively and is characterised by relatively small public debt, but also adequate budgetary discipline.
Latvia's commitment to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as the achievement of the objective of accession to the euro area, is another additional guarantee of positive trends in the current budgetary position.
From the long-term perspective, the sustainability of public finances is mainly influenced by ageing populations, leading to a shrinking population and their share of population and increasing demographic pressures.
The preliminary calculations of financial sustainability show that the ageing population is affected by the Latvian society and the economy and public finances of the country, but thanks to the pension reform introduced, it does not have any consequences.
Latvia ’ s small public debt and pressures on increasing costs give the government some flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances.
It must be noted, however, that the ageing population will try a health system in a new way.
The breakdown of health costs according to age groups clearly shows that higher costs will fall to older people whose number increases significantly over the next 50 years.
Long-term care costs are currently relatively small in Latvia due to the limited resources of the government and local authorities, but also from the traditions and values of society.
At the same time, the health of other demographic groups must also be ensured as the overall incidence of morbidity is high.
The government will develop an effective health care system based on long-term perspectives.
Changes in national monetary policy are needed to adapt substantially to the current demographic situation.
Since the demographic burden increases in the long term, the increase in living standards for all population groups will play a decisive role in increasing GDP based on increased productivity.
It is therefore important to ensure that the main wealth of Latvia is educated in accordance with the labour market requirements, in order to create an accessible labour market (see section 3).
In the overall development of the Latvian State, the forest, as it meets the requirements of the wood processing, one of the raw materials of the largest export sector in Latvia.
The forest is also important in rural development, as it provides a livelihood for residents working in different areas, 150 000 forest owners and forestry companies.
Part of the revenue generated by the harvest and harvest or services shall be invested in the forest owner to maintain or maintain the value of the forest.
The largest forest owners (country, local authorities and some private forestry companies to which thousands of hectares belong to forests) can ensure a continuous production process throughout the long forest management cycle.
Taking into account the composition, age, structure, previous administrative practice, economic situation of the rural region, but also forest owners ’ knowledge, the continuous forest production is significantly hampered by forest production.
In the light of the above, there is currently insufficient investment in the restoration of forest value in privatisation (revenues); it is therefore necessary to promote the productivity of wood (timely and high-quality upgrading of forests, the use of forest reproductive material in forest renewal, the growing of young people), particularly in private bodies.
Although Latvia's waste management systems have been complemented and society's awareness of the need to reduce the production of garbage has increased, the amount of garbage generated is rising every year.
The possibility of processing and utilisation of waste is insufficient, although companies can obtain subsidies for the collection and disposal of waste from environmentally harmful goods from the Latvian environmental protection fund and products.
Water management infrastructures (water supply and waste water collection and handling) are inadequately developed and obsolete, its capacity is not economically justified, the technologies used are costly and not to all environmental requirements.
It restricts the development of activity, especially in remote areas of the country.
Access to water infrastructure is very much affected by the development of communutilities, social catering, health and tourism industries.
Latvia must determine the time-limit for transposition of internal market rules, but also to ensure monitoring of the implementation of the national management and political management directives.
As at 7 September 2005, Latvia had not informed the EU of the transposition of EU directives (or 0,5% of the total number of directives).
Having regard to the fact that 99,5% of the Directives were transposed into Latvian regulations as at 7 September 2005, it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective is met by at least 98,5% of the directives or a deficit of 1.5% of the directives.
Transposition and implementation of internal market directives depend directly on establishing a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation.
As far as the current transposition of EU legislation is concerned, an effective database has not been established to monitor the transposition process within a number of reference points, and therefore – in addition to other circumstances – the transposition process is slowed down and the creation of the EU internal market framework is hampered.
The scarce staff of public administrations will reduce their capacity to ensure a qualitative and timely compliance with the EU's transposition process in the Latvian legal system.
The restrictions on the freedoms of the EU internal market were lost before Latvia's accession to the EU, but there are obstacles to cross-border transactions.
Significant obstacles arise from existing licensing requirements and time-consuming administrative operations requiring businesses to spend extra money and time and have the worst impact on small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and compliance of existing systems of licensing and other restrictions on EU requirements, including liberal professions (lawyers, notaries, accountants, architects, engineers and pharmacists) in order to promote competitiveness in these sectors.
For the introduction of harmonised and harmonised competition rules, Latvian competition standards were harmonised in 2004 according to the requirements of EU competition standards.
In case of obstacles to competition, or prevention of potential distortions of competition, the Competition Office of Latvia launched an active cooperation between the European Commission and the NCA Member States.
The electricity market is gradually opening.
As at 1 July 2004, a qualified free consumer status threshold for legal persons was set at 0,0 GWh.
Therefore, only households cannot be choosed to choose the supplier and the opening of the electricity market is guaranteed to 75%.
Until now, none of the free customers switched the electricity supplier.
In order to stimulate competition and to encourage the entry of alternative suppliers, the functions of transferring electricity and distribution are legally and functionally separated from the functions of electricity generation and sale.
The conditions for electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law.
The EU will build our common future and take global commitments using only 1% of its wealth.
In the focus of the austerity decisions, it is for today's world to respond to the challenges posed by our societies in the interests of better lives of EU citizens.
The European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the EU, representing the 736 members of the European Parliament representing you, the citizens of the 27 EU Member States will select them every five years on behalf of the Union's 500 million citizens.
This section of our website will find information on how Parliament operates its work through a system of various committees, and the work of the European Parliament is therefore important because decisions on new European laws are jointly made by the Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Parliament has an active role in drawing up legislation affecting the daily lives of its citizens, such as environmental protection, consumer rights, equal opportunities, transport and the free movement of workers, capital, services and goods.
The European Parliament is composed of 736 members elected in the 27 Member States of the enlarged European Union.
Since 1979, MEPs have been elected by direct universal suffrage for five years.

As a general rule, places are distributed in proportion to the population of each Member State.
Each Member State has a certain number of seats – most of 99 and least 5.
Equality between men and women: the role of women in the European Parliament is strongly increasing.
At present, women are women over a third of Parliament's members.

What better way to ensure transparency and accessibility for Parliament's work?
Multilingualism in European agreements firmly reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union.
It also makes the European institutions more accessible to the public and more transparent, helping to ensure the success of the EU's democratic system.
The European Parliament distinguishes from other EU institutions its responsibility to ensure multilingualism to the greatest possible extent.
All EU citizens must be able to access them directly in their own language.
And since every European citizen has the right to stand in elections to the European Parliament, it is unreasonable to require members of a common language to have a common language.
The right of each member to read Parliament's documents in his language shall be followed, followed by the word expressly laid down in Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
In addition, the European Parliament, as legislator, must ensure that all acceptable legislative acts are good in all official languages.
Furthermore, the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament's work, ask questions and receive answers in their language.
The European Parliament, in its resolution on 9 October, that "experience gained from previous European elections and referendums shows that most people who are aware of the EU issues and interested parties are less likely to participate and less likely to participate".
On the eve of the European Parliament elections in October 2009, the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration on Communicating Europe in Partnership with a view to highlighting the necessary political preparedness for all EU institutions and Member States for the EU's information work on the European Union.
The main objective of the joint declaration is to give citizens fair and diverse information on the EU, so that they can actively speak in the public debate on the European Union.
The EU, in cooperation with the Member States, took the joint declaration to address problems of Community-wide Community-wide communication with the Member States in order to ensure the highest possible level of communication at the right level.
In this context, they expressed their desire to develop synergies with national, regional and local authorities and representatives of civil society.
Although each Member State and each institution have its communication strategy and its priorities, Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed on a small number of common communication priorities for each year.
In addition, the Commission is invited to provide feedback to other EU institutions at the beginning of each year on the main achievements of the implementation of the common communication priorities for the previous year.

He wasn't the only son of his father, even though his brother was oldest; his brother William made his business in Cuckold's pool and the shores of Avon St. Philip, and he had three sisters on the shore, and he had three sisters.
Morgans ’ s nests were found in a number of places, but the Russians of the Richart clan - who were believed to have travelled in Wales in times of time - had been living in a certain position to achieve a certain position in the municipality of the municipality.
Richard's father wasn't one of them, but he didn't have a reason to embarrass.
After a short study in primary school, he went to work as a househouse, and later, a free man, a free man who paid his fines, tried to stay in the desert owner.
He also arranged a socially suitable marriage; Margaret Biggs was from Bedminster's sources of wealthy peasant peasant, and, among other things, to write the reading skills, even though he did not understand.
Children, the first of these girl, came to the weather with sufficient frequency, so that one of them would suffer unbearable pain and grief.
When Dick learned to rule out so much before the ejaculating, the number of children survived with two living sons and three girls.
Quite a family, and enough small enough to take care of it.
Dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read and write, and his hopes focused on Richard when it became clear that two years younger than that.
So, if Richard was seven years old, he was chased by Colston School School School and got a famous blue coat that declared bristolans that his father was poor but honorable.
And in the next five years, he was filled with literacy and numeracy.
He learned to write a nice hand, to calculate, chew himself through Caesar's Gallia wars, Cicero's calls and Ovidius Metamorphoses, and the words of the helpless.
Since he was a good student, even though the eyebrows are far away, and the petty art of polite restraint, he escaped from the charity of Mr. Colston's charity, and a greater benefit than many others.
At the age of 12, it was time to leave school and to find a business or a professional profession in the education level.
As a surprise to the relatives, he didn't choose any of the Morgans's existing activities.
His greatest forgiveness proved to be a mechanic, a piece of things, and it was an admirable patience for a young man.
And on my own choice, he became a student of Master Tomas Habitas, who held a weapon of weapons.
The father felt the silent joy of the decision, he had a reminder that one of Morgans grew a craftsman, not a trader.
Besides, the war was part of life, and the war needed guns.
The man who made the weapons and repaired it didn't threaten the threat to the battlefield.
For Richardi, seven years of apprenticeships were happy for work and learning, even though it was a little modest for physical pleasures.
As the other students, he worked for hire, living in the family's house, served him at the dinner table, filled the stomach with food residues and slept on the floor.
Fortunately, Lord Tomas Habitas was a good master and even better a gun.
Although he managed to prepare beautiful duel guns and shotguns, he had enough to understand that they had to be in Manton, but Manton couldn't be outside of London.
So it was his job, the 46-inch decorations called "Bessix Bessix."
At the age of nineteen, Richard received a masterpiece and moved out of Habitas's household, but not his workshop.
That's where he continued to work on Pruunide Besside.
And she married, as a woman who had a grandapprenticeship had changed.
Spouses became his mother's brother, maybe a muscle nephew, but that the English Church had no objection to it, his bride at St. James's church in the altar of his church.
The marriage was arranged, but there was a love of love between the spouses in the years.
Although there were some confusion about the son of Richard Morgan and Margaret Briggs, Richard Morgan, he was married to Margaret Briggs.
Until the Habitas arms shop fully worked, there was nothing strange about the fact that the young couple lived in the Temple Street of Temple Street, Habitas, Habitas, and a Jewish synagogue.
Marriage was concluded in 1767, three years after the end of the seven-year war with France in the unpopular peace agreement, in spite of the difficulties in the debt of England to raise taxes, and the neswering army and the fleet sharply tighten up.
The weapons were no longer required, so they left the champions and the students at Habitas, until the entire company was in Richards and Lord Tomas Habitan himself.
And then, for a while after a little Mary was born in 1770, Habitas was reluctant to have Richard's pride.
"come to work," Dick Morgan was kindly invited.
"The railways are coming and go, but the rum remains."
And that's what happened, despite the problem.
Richard's mother was always invited briefly to Mag and Richard's wife Peg, both of Margaret.
However, the problem was that all men in England - if the descendants of the rigid left protestors, who were crossed into Cranfield and Onesiphorus- - were either the name of John, Mr Williams, Mr Elizabeth, the Jamess or Mr Thomas.
It was one of the few practices that fit everyone, the king to the bees.
This is what I see for the first time! ”
It called the caliber who had just crushed the surface of a research ship on the surface and became the word of excitement.
After the ladder swimmed, he took the plates and the mask and handed them to the waiting ferry.
Then he stretched himself out of the water by losing a balance under the weight of the cylinders for a moment, but landing beneath the top of the ship and the whole ship.
In the moment, the dripping statue was surrounded by other crew members who were already waiting on the dive deck.
Jack Howard stepped down from the bridge and smiled to a friend.
He still couldn't believe that the bodyguard can move under the water so special.
On the back of the deck, he opened up his mouth when he was in a dive, and he had a lovely year in his friend's tonic.
"And we thought you were swimming back to Athens and sitting in the gin and tonic in your father's pool.
The study is not based on solid qualitative data, forecasts or personal opinions, but have been assembled from many sources, including interviews, arrogance, trends and evaluations.
All data before 1990 are based on interviews and online searches on numerous newspapers, television and radio, more specifically in search of information collection methods used earlier.
The schedule for the period after 1998 is based on everything that has happened over the last 11 years, which I have read about around 1000 different studies.
The 2009 and the next years will be based on forecasts from me and other people for the years ahead.
The graphs do not claim a hundred percent precision, their purpose is to give an overview of changes in the situation and outline social media news, targeted communication and other such future.
The article aims to make people think.
We are currently seeing a whole new way of how people can communicate - what makes traditional ways of simple ways.
This is a fundamental change that makes the world, which we feel, completely.
The best thing about this is that you can help get it done.
Come with me to the last 210-year-old in the information source, plus a glimpse of the next ten years.
Before we start exploring the future, we'll see how we arrived today, so we go back to 1800 where finding the information was completely different.
In the 1800s, people came out to communicate and meet them.
Everything was face-to-face.
For the sale of a product, you should have gone to the local market and the only possibility to communicate with the local market, to meet a personal or set table.
It meant that it was in the right place to obtain information or to give it to it in time.
You didn't know what was going on in some other town, and couldn't sell your products to people in another place.
They were told about a novel concept called a newspaper...
By 1900, the newspapers and magazines have changed their communication, enabling us to get the news where we were never.
We got our ideas to the people we never saw, and sell our products to others who were far away.
We had to go out and talk to other people, but we got to be aware of our town without leaving our city.
It was unbelievable, the first real revolution.
The world began to open everyone.
Since 1920, a new source of information for people's attention - radio.
Suddenly, listen to another person's voice from hundreds of miles away.
But most importantly, the latest information was possible to get in real time.
It was the next huge development in history.
However, the radio development period meant that, until 1960, our lives were dominated by the newspapers.
If you wanted to get the latest news or introduce your product to people, you'd have used the paper.
It seems that these are the most extensive source of information.
This situation began to change in 1960.
The radio came after and two main sources of information were transmitted in real time from the radio and more detailed news transmitted through newspapers and magazines.
It was a great time for the media, although some said that "for the newspapers to compete with the radio, better newspapers should be made" - an argument that we could hear repeatedly about the next 50 years.
In the next 40 years, the next technology revolution was introduced.
It started to collect public interest in the '1950s and the early 1990s was a big, southwest, big newspaper and magazines, but still dominated by radio.
Now people get information as well as watching.
Years ago, it was also time for the publishers of newspapers to understand that something is terribly wrong with their sales market.
They had a lot of trouble on radio competition, but television was another class.
Only eight years later, and television was ruled by the information world, the radio was almost only "place where to listen to free music" and newspapers did everything that could be done.
The continuous development of technology continued with the persistence of which was never seen.
A new phenomenon in the shadows: Internet.
1998 was the year when the Internet became a strange place, which was not much important, unquestionably, by bringing the attitude to that every company must have a website.
The revolution has started three years earlier, but in 1998 it reached a critical mass and tried to pay attention, despite the fact that it was used relatively little and most people had no access.
However, everyone agreed that it was the future - the beginning of a new era.
It was a place where everyone could have received information from everywhere - at least in theory.
People started to understand that the Internet was more than just information.
When you joined the conversation, you could give something back and be part of it instead of being a watcher.
However, the most important thing was to choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it.
The Internet's opportunities were hideous.
In 2004, only six years later, the Internet had changed how we were content.
However, television and newspapers dominated our news sources, but the latest world was definitely on the Internet.
People made new websites and discovered online applications.
People were able to do so much and participate in many areas so as to emerge from the new concept: the overload of information.
For the first time in my life we were in contact with more information than we were able to absorb.
In the age of newspapers, we had to choose what we wanted to see.
In 2004, we had to choose what we did not want to see.
It had a devastating effect on the traditional image of information.
In the past, it was possible to get people's attention in doing something.
People wanted more choices, so they just came to give them a new choice.
In 2004, this changed because something different was not enough: it had to be better.
2004 was also a year when another phenomenon started to emerge: communication networks.
This concept was quietly collected by a flat blog.
It was easy for everyone, easy and accessible to share their ideas.
For the first time, everyone had a chance to create their own information, without any technical work.
The handling of information became a tool of professional tools for all tools.
Three years later, and the social element of the Internet showed how powerful people really are.
For the first time, television was no longer a source of information, and newspapers fought for survival.
Everyone wanted to create his little world and connect it to his friends.
2007 was also a breakpoint for traditional websites that were compared with the newspapers in the newspapers - static and passive information.
We wanted an active information.
We wanted to be part of this, not just watching it.
Blogs started getting into trouble.
As television was eliminated by the radio (as it was better and more richer to provide people with information), the social networks blocked the social networks.
The social profile is more active for people to share what they care about.
Social networks are simply better and blogs are not able to stay behind.
Two years later, today, the new Internet will dominate our world completely.
Newspapers are dead in the water and people are watching less television than ever.
We are new kings, using the tools of social networks to contact and communicate.
Even the traditional website dies, which has been killed by the constant force of the constant flow of information from social networks.
Over the last 210 years we have seen an amazing development, how we can obtain information.
The main steps are:
1. information from remote places.
2. getting it in real time.
3. seeing it in real time.
4. deciding when to look at something and watch.
5. possibility to take part and comment.
6.
7.
2009 is the beginning of the next revolution.
All we know is changing.
The first and most dramatic change is the concept of social news.
It will quickly take over our need to know what is happening in the world.
The news will no longer be transmitted by journalists because now it has to be all.
They will be sent to you directly from the source, skipping traditional media.
Instead of the journalist broadcasting what analysts say, you can hear it from the analyst.
Social news gets the news from the source straight and uncensored.
A new wave of entertainment is emerging (bright blue and purple areas) dominating games, video and sound flows.
Instead of putting on a TV channel, you decide what you want to look at and when you want to look at it.
We will no longer join the channels where anyone else decides what we can look at.
You control the entire experience.
In the form of a targeted information, a new concept is slowly emerging.
We already see a growing number of mobile telephony services that provide local information about this region where you are.
For example, instead of showing all the restaurants in the world, the phone will only show the list in your area.
It's something that's growing up in the coming years.
In the world where we have access to more information than we can consume, the relevant information is a very important element, extending much further to the simple location that we see today.
In the next five or ten years the information world will change.
All traditional forms die eventually.
Printed newspapers no longer exist, television in the form of current channels is replaced by individual consignments that can be looked at if you want.
Radio programmes are intended to replace voice voices and video broadcasts.
Websites have a much smaller role - their primary function is the distribution of activities that can be done elsewhere, becoming a place where people can use raw materials in other places.
Many websites and networks will join one.
Social news, as described previously, will become the dominant way of communicating people.
Traditional journalism will be fully replaced by people who get information directly from the source.
Everyone is a potential reporter, but new advantages for the use of target groups will remove most of the noise.
Journalists will become editors, instead of broadening the news, giving us a bigger picture.
The future of the future is personalised, and it will constantly change according to what you look at, much in the same way that Last.fm does with music today.
Everything contains a target group.
You have control of every single infestation that moves towards you.
Two new concepts will emerge in 2010.
One of them is intelligent information where information flows can be included in several different news sources, not just pulling data, but taking it together, sharing it and issuing valuable parts.
Instead of a five different reading in the same way, you will be given one, highlighting important points of interest.
How secure are your Christmas lights?
EU tests show serious risks to the electric shock and fire integrity.
Stay safe. turn them off when you go to bed or get out of the house.
The market investigation carried out by the Commission pointed out that each set of Christmas lights had a direct risk of fire safety or shock.
The tests were carried out in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia with a total of 200 sheep sets of all price categories.
The samples were checked over 20 claims and many failed in more than one test.
The Commission found a large number of sheep ’ s wiring, weak lead and poor insulation.
Only over 40% of the samples were made in China.
In Hungary, almost 96% of the lamps were found to be dangerous.
In the Netherlands, 56% did not respond to EU security standards.
Although only five countries took part in the survey, it is likely that the same lamps are sold across the EU.
The Commissioner for Consumer Protection Maglena Kuneva said that the results were awake.
He urged EU Member States to work better on security requirements and said that industry (producers, retailers, retailers and importers) should also make control more effective.
In the case of customers, he stressed vigilance by providing the following advice: 1.
In Stockholm, some 4 000 participants are expected to take part in the Stockholm event, with the presentation of EU efforts to make development more effective.
The general theme "citizens and development" will focus on the impact of this year on the effects of global warming and the economic downturn of poorer countries.
Although they are usually the last ones to blame, especially those countries are affected by the economic decline and climate change.
Increased levels of sea level, desertification and increased frequency and more serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and unprecedented development goals.
And the current economic climate has led to a reduction in assisting donations for developing countries, reducing food guarantees in already vulnerable areas.
Bringing together politicians, public officials, NGOs, business leaders, academics, academics and media, the European Development Days offer the opportunity to establish relations, sharing experiences and developing new partners for development projects.
The three days of the event, which begins on 22 October, includes training, discussion forums and workshops.
"Development village" offers organisations the opportunity to introduce themselves to delegates and to the public and raise awareness of their objectives.
A number of awards will be distributed, including Lorenzo Natali's journalism prize for human rights, democracy and development challenges.
Youth development bonus goes for teenagers or videos showing human development in Africa.
The EU will also make public the first European progress report on the day.
This represents the dispatch of dispatch to the EU approach to sub-Saharan Africa countries.
The EU provides more than half of all development aid.
The donors conference sends strong signals to Georgia.
Until later, Georgia was the fastest growing economy in the world, 12% in 2007.
This changed in August, but in the course of the tense conflict with Russia.
Key transport lines and utilities were damaged, buildings and houses became a stone bubble and bombs destroyed large forest areas.
More than two months later, many foreign investors have left, tourists have gone, unemployment has risen and many georgies have drained their bank accounts.
The World Bank now predicts that Georgia, the energy source of energy in Europe needs EUR 2.4 billion to recover.
Over the next three years, the EU has allocated EUR 500 million and the US has promised EUR 757 million (1 billion dollars) over half of this year.
The EU and the World Bank were hosting donors' conference on 22 October to meet the remaining €1.1 billion.
Nearly 70 countries and the institution were invited to the event.
The aid supports reconstruction and helps the Georgian Government to meet the first needs of those people who had to escape their homes.
Tens of thousands of people were resettled, many of them still find shelter in temporary refugee centres.
But the longer-term goal is to restore Georgia's economy, which has made great changes in recent years.
"It is important that the crisis does not lead Georgia away from making political and economic reforms, which is now more important than before the conflict" said Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
The former Soviet Republic is usually about EUR 40 million per year from the European Union.
Between Georgia and Russia, there are differences between South Ossetia and Abkhazia - two separate Georgian province, which Russia recognises as independent countries.
Two sides have the first peace talks in Geneva on 15 October and talks will continue under the auspices of the UN and European intermediaries in November.
This allowed EU observers to move to the ceasefire monitoring areas.
Thousands of Russian soldiers have left the separatists.
European musicians were awarded for a well-selling debution.
Ten new stars share the light of the European Border Breakers Awards at the event.
Recognising the success of the wider audience, European Awards are prizes for musicians whose dedescent is well sold in the European Union (except their home country).
The winners of this year are the hottest names of the European music landscape - Adele (British), Alphabeat (Denmark), Aaron (France), Cinema Bizarre (Germany), The Dø Corr (Netherlands), The Script (Denmark) and The Ting Corr (Netherlands),
The prizes will be handed over to the Eurosonic Noorderslag opening in the Dutch city of Groningen, which is also transferred on television.
The event that includes presentations of current and previous winners is the British TV character Jools Holland.
Now, in its sixth year, the prize is an international success and support for the European music industry, which offers work about 600 000 people.
The former winners are now known artists like Carla Bruni, Tokio Hotel, Damien Rice, The Fratellis and Gabriel Rios, who lives in Belgium.
He is present at the ceremony of this year, recorded and transferred in real time via the EBU TVand radio network on Saturday, 17 January, beginning at 20: 15 (CET).
One of the last year winners was Finland's rock band Sunrise Avenue, which became victory for his "The Way to Wonderland" album.
Mikko Saukkonen, the band Bonnier Amigo's campaign campaign, said that the prize is a group that is recording the second album now.
"we are very sure that this will help the band in future."
The 2008 Cannes festival shows the success of the EU films in the world.
Fourteen film, which has partly supported the EU Media Programme, has been selected by 61 Cannes International film festival.
Film festivals are no longer a stranger to EU funding and have seen millions of people over the years.
The EU media programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of the continent through the film.
However, European film makers are facing major challenges both internationally and at home.
In 19th May, in the sixth ‘ Europe Day ’, EU representatives will sit together with European film ministers and producers to discuss how to encourage the audiovisual industry to increase international cooperation.
The aim is to broaden the circulation of content into other parts of the world and cooperate more closely with other EU film industries.
Such an international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films.
The choice of Cannes Festival last year included some film financed by the EU Media Programme.
And at the beginning of this year, many films (e.g. The counterfeiters and La Môme) were presented to Oscarians.
Fourteen EU-funded film Cannes festivals were: Gomor, Delta, La frontière de l'aube de Lorna, The Palermo Shooting, sangue pazzo, sangue pazzo, Entre les.
At the EU-China Summit in Prague on 20 May, climate change, financial crisis and economic relations were dominated.
The EU and China signed agreements to expand cooperation on science and technology, clean energy and small business.
They reaffirmed their commitment to the project in order to develop technology to produce electricity from coal without isolating carbon dioxide, one of the main causes of global warming.
Two sides discussed the views of the international climate change debate in Copenhagen in December.
The EU recommends developing economies, such as China, to restrict carbon emissions by providing financial support from developed countries.
In the financial crisis, the EU and China agreed that international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic risks and emerging and emerging economies should have more say in these institutions.
At the peak of the peak in May in May, two sides highlighted trade and investment as key economic recovery.
The two sides discussed the human rights situation in Tibet and conflicts in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Pakistan - three countries in which China has significant influence.

On Wednesday, 9 December Bonn, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, became a private entrepreneurial private enterprise for the promotion of private enterprise policy.
The prize was awarded by Mr Peter Jungen, President of the EU, who stressed that the main objective of the prize is to shape the EU's policy more in a more SME-friendly way.
The Latvian Prime Minister thanked the SME Union for its recognition and the contribution made to the development of an investment friendly and efficient business environment in Europe.
V. Dombrovskis stressed that the SME Unionnetwork has contributed to the idea that micro-economic support measures in Latvia are introduced.
The Latvian Government has taken steps not only to ensure fiscal sustainability but also develop a support programme for the Latvian micro-economy which is aimed at reducing obstacles to micro-economic activity and encouraging unemployed people to start their business.
In order to achieve the objective, the government has adopted a decision to reduce the requirements of the company ’ s free capital and registration costs, simplified tax information and accounting procedures and ensuring financial support for microeconomic activities.
In his speech, Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are a driving force for the economy, contributing to the decline in unemployment, long-term development and stability.
We have already announced that, on dates 8-10 December, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis will attend the Congress of the European People's Party in Bonn, Germany.
The governance group of reforms has agreed to the interconnected exchange of information signed on Monday 2 November, on Monday 2 November, making an assessment of the work of the current group and bringing the structural reforms to the fore.
The exchange of information corresponds to the cooperation model established by the government and non-governmental bodies representing the joint responsibility for the socio-economic situation in the country, Latvia's international commitments and their impact on future developments.
The governance group has set priorities for these tasks, focusing directly on the competitiveness, growth and recovery of the country.
The group stresses that the assessment of the combined core functions carried out and the rational use of potential sources of public budgets has been progress in defining the reduction of funding in accordance with the results of the tasks and the assessment of functions aimed at eliminating linear financing.
Although agreement was reached on objectives - small and efficient administration, expansion of internal and external markets for Latvia and promoting employment - shared the group's general opinion on the need to continue to work towards a clearer framework for the future structural reforms.
The Reformimanagement Group believes that it is necessary to continue the active introduction of social security measures, measures contained in economic recovery plans aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and attracting investment, a profound analysis of the role of micro-economic activities and the introduction of the concept of business in the organisation of the service.
The Reformimanagement Group has accepted the need to accelerate the introduction of EU programmes, which have been delayed over the current period and achieved five years of the year, also reflecting the need to implement the medium-term budget, by linking the external market to future development priorities, by creating an attractive investment climate for future development priorities.
The Reformian Group was set up in July 2009 with a view to ensuring public participation in reducing the budget and making decisions.
On 26 November and 27 November, the International Conference in Riga held an international conference in the European Union.
Latvia and Estonia agree jointly to lease the diplomatic representation of the territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt.
Since 1 January 2010, Latvia and Estonia work together in the rented complex in the Egyptian Arab Republic optimising their administrative costs.
The agreement was reached between the Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins and the Foreign Minister Urmas Paeti in the course of his official visit to Rio on 18 February, this year, and ended with the following talks between Foreign Ministers.
This initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Baltic States in the light of the Presidency of the Baltic Council of Ministers in 2010, which will be taken by Latvia in 2010 in order to introduce similar projects in the future.
The Latvian embassy in Cairo has acted since 2007, which was officially opened in March 2009 during the visit of Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins to Egypt.
Since 2010, Estonia ’ s Representation will start in Egypt on premises which are rented with Latvia.
Latvia is represented by Maris Selga since the Arab Republic of Egypt.
The Foreign Minister Maris Riekstinsi phone conversation with Russia's Foreign Minister called for a quick solution to the situation of freight carriers at the Latvian border.
On Wednesday, the Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins and the Russian Federation took place between the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, both parties discussed the results of relations between countries in 2009, as well as the current developments in the situation of the Russian border.
Both foreign ministers shared the view that the situation of mutual relations in this year could generally be assessed positively.
Next, ministers reviewed the agenda in the forthcoming year of EU-Russia relations, including further improvements in the legal framework, such as a number of important agreements between governments to sign.
Ministers and Lavrov also discussed the current situation on freight carriers at the Latvian and Russian border.
As a result of the increased customs controls of the Russian Federation, the situation is dramatic and the border of Latvia is a dramatic solution to release the Latvian side of Latvia, because it causes significant losses, the foreign minister, RIEKSTINS.
Ministers agreed that the respective institutions of both countries, including the Latvijas Association for Latvijas Auto, should continue efforts to normalise the situation in the near future according to the agreement reached on 18 December of the Intergovernmental Panel on Transport.

Dear Mrs. Brown,
I'm a student at DeLand's High School, and I'm considering a future career as a career.
The family friend Dr. Randall Hansen Stetsoni from the University of Steon suggested that you might be willing to let me spend one day watching you watch a bank.
I know I'm asking quite a lot, but I would be extremely grateful if you would allow me to keep track of you, or within the entire day of working day if you perform your normal schedule.
If possible, it would be useful if we had a short interview at the end of the workshop, so that I could ask questions that I would be able to follow after the follow-up of your activities and operations.
Thank you very much for taking my request.
I'll call you in a week.
If you are required to contact me before that, you can freely contact me (386-555-2922) or e-mail (kylie5843 @ yahoo.com).
Thank you for your time and reflection.
Sincerely, Kylie Appleton
Dear Sir,
I recently ordered a new pair of shoes (commodity code # 6542951) on your website on 21 June.
I got the order on June 26.
Unfortunately, when I opened it, I saw the shoes used.
The shoes were all the dirt and the little tear was part of the front, where the left toe goes.
My order number is AF26168156.
To solve the problem, I would like you to transfer money to my account, which was asked for their shoes.
I've already gone and bought a new pair of shoes from the local sports store, so the second pair would have two pair of same shoes.
Thank you for reading this letter for time.
I have been your company's satisfaction for many years and this is the first time I have encountered a problem.
If you need contact with me, you'll catch me at 555-5555.
Sincerely, Ken Thomas

Dear Miss Coling:
My name is Susan Harris and I will write to Lockwood High School students.
We would like to invite you to attend a special event that will take place at our school.
Your coming would honor us.
Please respond by Monday 26 February to confirm your presence.
We hope to see you here,
Sincerely, Susan Harris.
In 2007, the most powerful particle accelerated particle accelerator, the new Large Hadron Collider Collider, measure the secrets of the energy in the energy state that were only moments after the Big Pauku.
Let the particles fail if they move close to light speed, hoping to find information on the matter in the past, using the energy released in the event of collision.
What is expected of this great investment that Europe has made to produce the LHC?
It sends two proton speeds, particles that form the atomic core and which belong to the particle family, in different directions in the longitudinal range of 27 km, located under Switzerland and France.
To speed up the proton and to ensure that they are closed to narrow speed, strong magnetic fields are required, these fields are generated by superconductors, materials that are capable of driving electricity without hindrance or which have been produced in cooperation with European industry.
The proton collision will take place at a speed of eight million times a second in a massive energy amount of 14 TEV.
In order to understand the size of this figure, 1 TEV is about the amount of energy used to move a flying mosquito.
In the LHC, it will be concentrated in a million times less than a bug.
As energy can be transferred to particles according to a limited relative relative energy equivalence principle (represented by E = mc2), physicists rely on particles that have never been observed in speeds.
The frequency and intensity of collisions are important as they make the possibility of a larger particle appearance more visible.
Two core nuclear speeds are also emerging, with energy reaching 1 150 Tev, but a few seconds per second.
Search for supersymmetry...
Certain sensors are capable of analysing the impact.
The two names are CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and Atlas (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus).
They focus on detection of supersymmetrical particles and Higgins.
What's a supersymmetry?
Particle physics contain several symmetrical symmetrics, such as matter and antimatter.
Supersymmetry binds fermion (construction material for the matter, such as electrons and blocks) with each boss (transfer the transfer, such as photon) and vice versa.
The challenge lies in the fact that supersymmetrical supersymmetry (also assigned to the part) has never been seen before.
How to discover them?
Paradoxically, by their absence!
"it's kind of like being a movie.
You count the number and type of people entering and out.
If any person has disappeared at the end, because you know who entered the door, you can guess who did not.
In the same way, the LHC tests are known to result in these antiparticles that are invisible to all sensors.
Before the impact on the particle energy, they compare the energy of the particles which occurred after the impact.
If there are differences in energy, part has escaped.
In calculating the missing energy, they know whether the supersymmetry component or antidote is involved.
The second challenge of cms and LHS is the detection of the Higgs boss.
In the case of the reference point of the standard model theory, it is expected that this should be reciprocity and give them mass.
How?
Let's assume there's a roomful of physics.
Suddenly, Albert Einstein comes into the room, students gather around him and start bombing his questions.
If Albert tries to move, he knows a firm inertia, because of the students that are stamped on him.
He's similar to these particles as the Higgs boss trying to interact with them - they collect mass.
As well as the expected discovery of their famous bostons, it is only circumstantial: particles that result from their degradation, they are what they are discovered.
Kvargi-gluon soup
The third sensor, which LHC is equipped, is called Alice (big ion accelerator experiment).
It aims to detect parts of the unknown nuclear physics, especially the matter of matter, which existed in a very short time after the Big Pauku, and known as a quarter-guloni plasma name.
What's the new specificities?
In the '60s, scientists realized that proton and neutralized, which formed the nuclear core, were made even more of the original particles - blocks from blocks.
These blocks are strong forces (which are guided by a name called gluon) with each other.
One of their own is that they are diverse together: they are always either in mats or trips; they cannot exist alone.
The more you try to isolate Kvark from another quarter, the greater the force that keeps them together, making them permanently unisolated.
The quarks say they're in prison.
However, if the proton bombs are to be bombed against each other in large energy, the soup and soup containing gluones will be set up in which blocks can move freely.
Then we can refer to the release of blocks in the quarter-gluon soup.
What kind of release?
"this is somewhat comparable to skiing.
If there is not much snow, the runway can be separated by grass and skiers are limited to their construction.
On the other hand, if there's a lot of snow, they can change the path.
They are free from restrictions. "
Instead of snow, physicists add energy: the greater the power of the block, the weaker power, so the level of energy can be separated from the level of energy.
The plasma presence of Kvargi-gluon was probably a matter of microseconds after the Big Pauku.
This is why physicists want to examine it through the ionic irons created by the LHC.
By nature, they are very rich in proton and neutrons.
They may achieve energy 1 150 TEV, which is necessary for the plasma of the quarter-gluon, which was unprecedented at the beginning of the Universe, to create and investigate.
Mystery of antimatter
Finally, the last sensor called LHCb (a large Hadron of Hadron).
It is a task for a better monitoring of small differences between the matter and the antimatter, so that it can better understand what happened to the antimatter of the universe.
For each part of the part, an antibody is the same as the same mass, but the opposite charge.
Therefore, there is a negative mass for electronic communications, but an antielectric (or positron) with a positive loan.
If the electricity and the antielectric get together, they will destroy each other, the result is the energy pressure.
In accordance with the standard model of physics physics, an equal quantity of matter and antimatter was created at the beginning of the universe.
So all the particles should destroy each other and the universe should be empty.
However, as anyone can see, the matter is high.
This is where this question comes from, which LHCb is trying to answer: where is the antimatter?
One of the possible answers is based on the ability of certain particles to change themselves to their antiquities and vice versa.
In this case, the presence of the matter depends on the hypothesis (waiting for proof) that the transformation of the antiparticles into particles is addicted to the opposite transformation at the beginning of the universe.
Can this imbalance be demonstrated?
It's actually been experimentally examined with particles of the block called the cabin.
The Antikaaons are transformed spontaneously into the onset, but there is a lot less frequent.
LHCb is investigating another candidate, B-meson, which contains the basic component (or an antique) which is called a B block or a decorative (from where LCHb is also charming).
Although the particles cannot be seen, they can be detected.
To this end, LHC equipped with a number of concentric layers (such as onion), surrounded by particle speed, where the collision occurs.
Every layer specializes in detecting a particular type.
In the middle of the sensor, there are a number of millions of leaders inside that chamber that produce a power pulse when a part of it goes.
These impulses are recorded by computers.
There's a magnetic field inside every sensor.
It will help detect and investigate the particle (e.g. electric or proton) trajectory, which is sensitive to magnetic fields.
Second, the device is a calorimeter proposition.
Some calories stop particles like photons or electrons, but others are designed to stop neutrons and photons.
They measure the particle loss of the particles.
Assistance from strings
How to define the nature of the algosates separated from the mechanisms leading to their creation?
Apart from the standard model of physics (resulting in quantum mechanics), modern science has concentrated its hopes fully on the new concept that would offer a high level of mathematical theory.
This athletes the prospect of a completely new type of experimentation in CERN.
Standard model (the cornerstone of modern physics, which was taken at the centre of the 20th century), must be the exact components of the basic components that are driven by three particles of the particulate matter: electromagnetism and strong and weak forces.
This will allow us to offer descriptions that fit very well with what is going on in this endlessly small world.
However, this model does not take into account the fourth interaction - gravity.
Now, quantum physics, when the light presents itself with a particle, footon, with gravity, the gravity of gravity must be transferred to another part, graviton.
Search for harmonisation
As a result of this part of the standard model, there is an obstacle (see box).
In addition, at the beginning of the Universe, the universe was both extremely small and extreme (total energy and matter concentrated in very small spaces).
Consequently, the theory also describes the particles that dominated the previously dominated period, cannot be left aside.
How do we combine all this general relativity theory (out of Einstein at the beginning of the last century), which turns fully gravity around?
"The harmonisation of quantum mechanics and the overall relativity theory has become the real Holy Grail of physics.
Scientists are working on this problem.
The most promising route seems to be a string theory. "
Points to the points
What does this theory tell us about the world?
First, it will look at the particles, but if the elements, which can be compared with extremely small strings which are a 10-35 metres long (for a number of 35 zeroes, the first of them is on the left side).
These strings vibrating and the nature of their vibrations match the particles of particles.
The more string vibrates, the greater the amount of the energy.
One string theory that is necessary for its mathematical integrity is supersymmetry.
To understand what it is, a short description of the basic particles' zoology 'is necessary.
Kvantkehad in the universe will be divided into two families: on the one hand there is fermions composed of electrons and blocks, on the other side of the bostonite family where the fundamental links are to be used, as the photons of electromagnetic power, and graviton (mentioned above) for graviton.
Supersymmetry problem
Supersymmetry consists of the assumption that every part of the fermion family corresponds to a particle belonging to the boss's family and vice versa, so the symmetrical idea.
The Supersymmetrical part has not yet been detected, but the particles of the particle physics are counting on them with a high energy impact which they will soon create using LHC, a new particle accelerated acceleration in the LHC.
In the meantime, astronomers may indirectly monitor the effects of mysterious particles, as the total mass of galaxies and galaxies appears to be much greater than the generous mass (letters, gases, etc.) detected by the telescopic telescopes.
They therefore possess the presence of invisible black mass which is reciprocal with other matter only through gravity, and contains very stable, so very mild particles.
There are a number of key features that the lightest supersymetry particles share.
These may therefore be unfamiliar with the black mass ingredients, the phenomenon of which was examined for the first time by Switzerland by the astronomy Fritz Zwicky in 1933.
Four interactions between single interactions
Another issue that is problematic for researchers concerns the four fundamental interactions of nature.
Why are their strengths so different from each other?
For example, gravitational interactions are much weaker than that of electromagnetic interactions.
It is proof that the magnetic field is a sufficient magnetic field to attract a relatively large metal mass, while the gravity of the same mass is needed to move the same mass.
One question is that all the basic interactions are only one of the most influential interactions that began to fall at the beginning of the Universe.
Business stability is vital to the success of business.
And in the modern world, virtually every company has a vulnerability to interruption.
Some risks can interrupt your business for days, but in the competitive environment, even four hours can be fatal.
Due to the increase in the number of risks affecting business, the approach of the worst scenario "insurance policy" has become a worrying concern for sustainability.

In order to think about the infrastructure, a global and global perspective must be thought in a modern environment.
Access to information is critical and it is an obligation that the risk cannot afford to afford.
In the event of obsolete or reduced performance, intensities are gradually growing and the problem is dramatically distracted by the restoration of information and the loss of injury.
IBM storage and data services help customers prevent such tragedies and ensure that information is safely available at any time, all the time.
IBM Global Technology Services provide services to services
Help, enabling customers to obtain intel on how they use their LOBs and determine the best use of storage media throughout the company,
Provide broad information for the archive strategy,
