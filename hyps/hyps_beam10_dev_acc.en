the purpose of this report is to describe how the function of staff management should be established – to clarify the PH strategy and operations .
currently , the PH@@ -@@ fun@@ ction department is missing .
the idea of this report was on 22 September in the D@@ ace Ro@@ z leader of the EU@@ P@@ U .
however , the content of the PH@@ -@@ plan was also discussed with other entities : An@@ ita Bis@@ of@@ a , Val@@ da Ce@@ pu@@ ters and Val@@ dis Bis@@ ter@@ s .
the Mo@@ e Investment Department is growing rapidly and faces many changes over the coming years .
possible changes in the department &apos;s organisation are already at stake .
the pressure to deal effectively and correctly with work processes and staff matters is urgent .
in the current situation , directors and entities are so busy with projects , so that there is no time for the development of PH .
it is very desirable to appoint a person responsible for the PH to focus on the establishment of the Human Res@@ ources Management System and be able to develop it in the future in accordance with practical needs .
prior to the planning of the PH@@ U PH , the division and mission shall be clear .
the Investment Department strategy and the short-term action plan are recommended annually .
the participation of the EU , but also in national programmes , should be stressed in accordance with the real need .
the number of projects will increase considerably and more projects will reach the implementation phase affecting the number of workers needed and their areas of competence .
soon , the PR@@ K ( the Hand@@ book of implementation of the project ) and the P@@ K@@ J ( project guide ) will be prepared .
they should be used in this au@@ tumn .
the PR@@ K shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the relevant sub-@@ processes .
these instructions provide practical guidance on both the flow of work and the organisation .
these instructions should serve as a basis for the following steps such as writing and identifying the fields of competence .
the measures necessary for the development and further practical needs of the staff management system are described in Annex III .
the initial plan for the establishment of the PH@@ -@@ system is set out in Annex IV .
the background to the scheme is that the staff manager / coordin@@ ator can start full-@@ time work on the PH development at the beginning of December 2003 .
the Director and the Heads of Unit of the Department should cooperate closely with the staff management staff , to inform him of the need for continuous development and priorit@@ ise it .
they are also responsible for the development assessment and the discussion of the sco@@ reboard ; staff management will contribute to the up@@ grading of temp@@ lates and storage files .
the Heads of Unit must play an active role in developing issues and content issues .
the self-@@ assessment of competences involves all staff .
staff management coordin@@ ates the evaluation of competences and man@@ ages data files .
the draft budget for the year 2004 shall include both the costs of the PH development ( mainly the PH@@ -@@ worker , the staff of the units , the IT staff ) and the cost of training .
implementation costs consist of direct costs ( e.g. courses , le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs , materials ) , teaching and training from time to time , training of training participants and training and facilitation of training .
once a year , due to the lost working time , the cost also ar@@ ises from evaluation and PL@@ P .
an indicative evaluation of the 2004 training activities must be provided before any budgetary figures are offered .

in view of the invitation to the March 2005 Council meeting , Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for 2005-@@ 2008 ( ‘ the programme ’ ) , with a view to promoting national growth and employment .
the programme is a policy planning document , showing how the Lisbon Strategy aims to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in 2005-@@ 2008 , in line with the integrated guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005 .
the programme reflects the most important problems of the Lisbon Strategy in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and identify the main features of these problems and actions , but also the performance indicators for achieving these objectives .
the programme is based on the policy planning documents approved by the Republic of Latvia .
the programme was assisted by the Lisbon Council .
it was consulted ( Lat@@ vian Parliament ) and social partners .
the programme consists of an introductory part ( macroeconomic policy , micro@@ economic reforms , employment policy guidelines ) and annexes .
all figures and figures were received from the Statis@@ tical Office of the Republic of Latvia or Eurostat , except in cases specifically referred to .
in order to achieve these objectives , minis@@ tries will establish strategic plans for the preparation of strategic planning principles in line with the priorities set by the government , in line with the priorities set by the government in the medium-term development objectives and programmes and sub-@@ programmes , including their funding , and including their funding , and including their funding , and their funding , including their funding .
to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area ,
adopted the C@@ abin@@ et of Ministers on 21 July 2005 to establish a European single currency in Latvia with the task of developing a plan for the implementation of the necessary measures to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area .
on 31 December 2004 , public debt amoun@@ ted to 9@@ 75 million la@@ tin or 13@@ ,@@ 3 % of GDP .
public debt is expected to increase gradually in the coming years and may reach 13.@@ 6 % of GDP in 2008 .
Latvia ’ s sovereign debt is one of the smal@@ lest in the European Union and is expected to remain significantly below the State gross debt criterion in the medium term ( 60 % of GDP ) , as defined in the Maas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty .
on the basis of the information provided , Latvia does not have an urgent need to develop a specific plan to reduce public debt , but before taking any action in the area of government debt management , careful analysis of possible risks to the country should be carefully analysed .
the main proposed measures in the area of sovereign debt 2005-@@ 2008 ( Guideline 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary resources to finance the public budget deficit and to re@@ finance sovereign debt commitments as minimum as possible , by limiting financial risks and taking into account the development of the capital market and all financial systems of Latvia ( responsible authority :
– to develop new debt re@@ purchase and debt exchange programmes to manage debt re@@ financing risks in order to attract the opportunities offered by the capital market to attract long-term resources ,
- In continuing the reduction of the cost of external debt of the country , all existing provisions of external lending agreements will be reviewed in order to assess the future repayment of a number of loans in the future , re@@ financing these loans with other favourable loans or possible changes to the provisions of the loan agreement .
the sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed posi@@ tively and characterised by relatively low public debt , but also adequate budgetary discipline .
Latvia &apos;s commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact , as well as the objective of joining the euro area , is another additional guarantee of positive trends in the current budgetary position .
in a long-term perspective , the sustainability of public finances is mainly influen@@ ced by the ageing population , resulting in a shrin@@ king working age population and their role in the population and the demographic burden .
the initial calculations of financial sustainability show that the ageing of the population affects Lat@@ vian society and the economy and public finances , but thanks to the pension reform that has been introduced , it does not result in undue consequences .
Latvia &apos;s small public debt and the pressure of increasing costs will give government flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances .
it should be noted , however , that an ageing population makes a new approach to health care .
the distribution of health expenditure according to age groups clearly shows that higher costs will fall to older people whose number increases significantly over the next 50 years .
long-term care costs are currently relatively small in Latvia , due to limited resources from both government and local authorities , but also from society &apos;s traditions and values .
at the same time , the health of other demographic groups must also be ensured , as the overall level of mor@@ bid@@ ity is high .
the government will develop an effective health system based on long-term prospects .
in order to adapt significantly to the current demographic situation , changes in national monetary policy are necessary .
as the demographic burden increases in the long term , the increase in productivity based on living standards in all population groups plays a decisive role in increasing productivity .
it is therefore important to ensure the primary wealth of Latvia in line with the demands of the labour market , in order to create an accessible labour market ( see section 3 ) .
the forest , as it meets the requirements of the wood processing , the largest export sector in the Lat@@ vian industry , is also an important contribution to the overall development of the Lat@@ vian country &apos;s economy .
the forest is also an important resource for rural development because it provides a live@@ lihood for residents working in local areas , 150 000 forest owners and forestry companies .
part of the revenue generated by the final and de@@ br@@ is or services shall be invested by forest owner in order to maintain the value of the forest or to introduce continuous production .
the largest forest owners ( the country , local authorities and some of the private companies to whom thousands of hecta@@ res are owned by forests ) can ensure continuous production processes throughout the long forest management cycle .
taking into account the composition of tree species , age , structure , previous administrative practice , the economic situation of rural areas , but also the knowledge of forest owners is a constant obstacle to forest production in small forest owners .
due to these circumstances , there is currently insufficient investment in the rest@@ oration of forest value ( revenues ) ; it is therefore necessary to promote the production of wood ( timely and high quality of the forest , the use of selected forest reproductive material , the cultivation of wood in the forest ) , particularly in private companies .
although Latvia &apos;s waste management systems have been complemen@@ ted and the awareness of society about the need to reduce waste , the amount of waste generated is increasing every year .
the possibilities for processing and de@@ commissioning are insufficient , although companies can obtain subsidies from the environmental protection fund of Latvia from environmentally harmful goods and products to collect and de@@ commissioning waste .
water management infrastructures ( water supply and se@@ wage collection and handling ) are insuffici@@ ently developed and ob@@ s@@ olete , its capacity is not economically viable , the technologies used are energy intensive and not all environmental requirements .
it limits the development of the activity , particularly in remote regions in the country .
access to water management infrastructure is highly affected by the development of public u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties , social ca@@ tering , health and tourism industries .
Latvia must determine the time-@@ limit for transposition of internal market rules , but also to ensure monitoring of the transposition of the directives on supervision and political level at national level .
as at 7 September 2005 Latvia had not notified 1.3 % of the transposition of EU directives ( or 0.5 % of the total number of directives ) .
given that 9@@ 9.@@ 5 % of the Directives had been trans@@ posed into Lat@@ vian legislation as at 7 September 2005 , it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective is achieved by at least 98@@ ,5 % of the transposition or a deficit deficit of 1.5 % directives .
transposition and implementation of internal market directives will depend directly on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation .
at present , the monitoring of the transposition of EU legislation is not an effective database , which would provide the opportunity to monitor the transposition process over a number of reference points , and thus , in addition to other circumstances , the transposition process and the establishment of the EU internal market base .
the scar@@ ce staff of public administrations will reduce their capacity to ensure a qualitative and timely alignment of the EU directives to the Lat@@ vian legal system .
restrictions on the freedoms of the EU internal market were most lost before Latvia &apos;s accession to the EU , but the barriers to transactions above borders are still there .
significant obstacles arise from existing licensing requirements and time-@@ consum@@ ing administrative operations requiring companies to receive additional money and time and the worst of small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and compatibility with the EU requirements of existing licensing and other restrictions , including free professions ( lawyers , no@@ taries , accoun@@ tants , archite@@ cts , engine@@ ers and pharma@@ c@@ ists ) in order to promote competitiveness in these sectors .
in order to introduce harmonised and harmonised competition policy , the Lat@@ vian competition standards were harmonised in 2004 according to the EU competition standards .
in case of obstacles to competition across borders or to prevent potential distortions of competition , the Lat@@ vian Competition Authority ( NC@@ A ) - the Competition Council - active cooperation with the European Commission and the competition authorities of the EEA Member States .
the electricity market is gradually opening .
as at 1 July 2004 , the threshold for the status of qualified customers was set at 0.@@ 0 G@@ W@@ h .
therefore , only households can only choose the supplier , and the opening up of the electricity market is up to 75 % .
until now , no electricity supplier has changed the electricity supplier .
in order to stimulate competition and encourage the entry of alternative suppliers , the functions of transmission and distribution of electricity need to be legally and fun@@ ction@@ ally separated from the functions of electricity generation and sales .
the conditions for electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law .
the EU will build our common future and take global commitments , using only 1 % of their wealth per year .
the focus of spending decisions on the challenges of today &apos;s world is to meet the challenges of the EU &apos;s citizens in the interests of better life .
the European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the EU .
this part of our website will find information on how Parliament will organise its work through the various committees .
Parliament plays an active role in drawing up legislation on the daily lives of its citizens , such as environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods , and the Council and the Council have a common European Union budget .
the European Parliament consists of 7@@ 36 members elected from 27 Member States of the enlarged European Union .
since 19@@ 79 , MEPs have elected direct and universal elections for five years .
each Member State will decide which elections will be organised , but they must comply with the same democratic basic rules : gender equality and secret voting .
in all Member States , 18 years of electoral rights , except Austria , where it is 16 years .
the European elections are already governed by several common principles : direct and general elections , proportionate representation and five-@@ year term of office .
as a general rule , the proportion of the population of each Member State shall be distributed .
each Member State has a certain number of seats – most 99 and less than 5 .
equality between men and women : the role of women in the European Parliament is strongly increasing .
a few more than one third of MEPs are women .
MEPs will share their time between Brussels , Strasbourg and his district , and they will attend parliamentary committees and political groups and plenary sessions in Strasbourg .
in parallel , they must also de@@ vote time to their community .
members of the European Parliament are group@@ ed in common political views , not by nationality .
they shall exercise their mandate independently .
as the power of Members of the European Parliament is increasing , they will affect all the citizens &apos; every@@ day lives : the environment , consumer protection , transport and education , as well as education , culture , health , etc .
the new Statute of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 .
all Community languages are equally important in the European Parliament : all Parliament &apos;s documents will be published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) and each member of the European Parliament .
what would be better to ensure the transparency and accessibility of Parliament &apos;s work throughout the public ?
the multilingu@@ alism of the European treaties firmly reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes the European institutions more accessible and transparent to help ensure the success of the EU &apos;s democratic system .
the European Parliament distingu@@ ish@@ es from other EU institutions to ensure multilingu@@ alism in the largest possible extent .
all EU citizens must be able to acqu@@ ain@@ t themselves with legislation directly affecting them in their own language .
and since every European citizen has the right to stand in elections to the European Parliament , it is un@@ reasonable to require the members of a common language to have a perfect possession .
the right of each member to read Parliament &apos;s documents in his language , to observe the debates and to take the floor explicitly laid down in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure .
in addition , the European Parliament , as legisla@@ tor , must ensure the good linguistic quality of all legislative acts in all official languages .
furthermore , the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament &apos;s work , ask questions and receive answers in their language .
the European Parliament in its resolution of 9 October states that &amp; quot ; experience gained from previous European elections and refer@@ enda shows that it is more likely that people who are aware of issues related to the EU and interested in them are less likely to participate and participate in less informed citizens ’ .
on the eve of the European elections in October 2009 , the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration &amp; quot ; Communic@@ ating Europe &amp; quot ; in order to emphasise the need for political read@@ iness for all EU institutions and all levels of the Member States to work on the European Union .
the main objective of the joint declaration is to provide citizens with fair and diverse information on the EU , so that they can play an active part in the public debate on the European Union .
in the joint declaration , the EU took the task of sol@@ ving problems with the Member States in cooperation with the Member States , in order to ensure communication with the greatest target group at the right levels .
in this context , they expressed their desire to develop synergies with national , regional and local authorities and representatives of civil society .
although each Member State and each institution have its communication strategy and its priorities , Parliament agreed to establish a small number of common communication priorities for each year , together with the Council , the Council and the Commission .
in addition , the Commission invites the other EU institutions at the beginning of each year to feed@@ back from the main achievements in implementing the common communication priorities of the previous year .
the European Union was created to end the frequent bloody w@@ ars of the neighbours , which became the Second World War .
in 19@@ 50 , the European Co@@ al and S@@ teel Community will make the European Co@@ al and S@@ teel Community in the name of a lasting lasting peace .
six foun@@ ding countries are Belgium , the Netherlands , Italy , Luxembourg , France and Germany .
in the 19@@ 50@@ s , there is a cold war between East and West .
in Hungary , the prote@@ sts against the Commun@@ ist regime of the So@@ vi@@ et tan@@ ks in 19@@ 56 are pus@@ hed by the So@@ vi@@ et Union in the next 19@@ 57 , when the So@@ vi@@ et Union s@@ ends the first artificial partner S@@ pu@@ tn@@ ik@@ -1 .
in 19@@ 57 the Treaty of Rome establishes the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , or ‘ common market ’ .
in the 19@@ 60@@ s , the &amp; quot ; youth culture &amp; quot ; , the Be@@ at@@ les and other an@@ sa@@ mb@@ les will attract huge teen@@ ag@@ ers everywhere , by encouraging the cultural re@@ volution and the expansion of inter@@ gener@@ ational gap .
there are good times in the economy , partly because EU countries end customs duties on customs duties .
in addition , they will establish joint control of food production , resulting in enough food to eat and soon produce surplus agricultural products .
in May 19@@ 68 , in Paris , famous student un@@ rest and the &amp; quot ; 68 generation &amp; quot ; will be linked to a wide range of changes in society and human behaviour .
on 1 January 19@@ 73 , the number of members of the European Union will increase by 9 , if Ireland , Denmark and the United Kingdom are joined .
a short but violent Arab war in October 19@@ 73 brings energy crisis and economic problems in Europe .
the latest European right@@ -@@ wing dic@@ ta@@ tor@@ ships , when Sala@@ z@@ ar the Sala@@ z@@ ar regime is being dropped in 19@@ 74 , will die in Spain in 1975 .
the EU &apos;s regional policy will set up huge amounts of jobs for job creation and infrastructure development in po@@ ore@@ r regions .
the European Parliament &apos;s influence on EU business is increasing and the citizens will be able to choose the Members for the first time in 19@@ 79 .
in Europe and the world , the Polish trade union , Soli@@ dar@@ no@@ ś@@ ć and its leader L@@ ech Wal@@ es@@ a , will rise in the summer of 1980 .
in 19@@ 81 the EU will become a member of Greece and five years later , Spain and Portugal will join .
in 1987 the Single European Act will be signed .
this agreement provides the basis for a comprehensive six-@@ year programme aimed at resol@@ ving the EU &apos;s cross-border trade problems and thus developing a common market .
the political sho@@ cks will result in breaking the Berlin W@@ all on 9 November 1989 and re@@ opening the border between East and West Germany after the 28@@ -@@ year break .
the col@@ lapse of Commun@@ ism throughout Central and Eastern Europe strength@@ ens the neighbourhood relations of Europeans .
in 1993 , the creation of a common market , the &amp; quot ; four fundamental freedoms &amp; quot ; , is the free movement of goods , services , people and money .
two new agreements are also concluded in the 199@@ 0s : the Treaty of 1993 , or the Maas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty , and the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999 .
citizens are increasingly concerned about protecting the environment , while looking for new opportunities for European security and defence work .
in 1995 the EU will receive three new members , Austria , Finland and Sweden .
the Schengen agreements with the small town of Luxembourg are gradually creating a possibility for people to travel without issuing a passport at national borders .
millions of young people go through the EU with support in other countries .
communication will become easier and more people are to use mobile phones and Internet .
many Europeans become the new currency of the euro .
the political gap between East and West Europe will be fin@@ alised in 2004 , when the EU is not less or more than 10 new countries .
many believe that Europe now has time for its constitution , but it is far from easy to agree on what it should be and debate on the future of Europe .
the euro will allow prices to be compared directly in all Member States that use it .
transnational travel is easier , as there is no longer a cost of money exchange and effort .
competition with the common market has helped to increase quality and lower prices .
phone calls , Internet connection and air travel .
the EU prote@@ cts consumers from defec@@ tive and un@@ quality products regardless of whether goods are purchased from home or from another country .
the EU will also establish the highest standards of food safety .
EU citizens can live , work or retirement in other EU countries .
temporary restrictions on the free movement of workers from 12 new@@ est Member States are progressi@@ vely eliminated .
over two million young people have been stu@@ dying or training for EU programmes in another European country .
thanks to this , every student and other lear@@ ners , Erasmus , Leon@@ ardo and other cross-border partnerships are aware .
the EU does not decide what school lear@@ ns , but seeks to ensure that the education and qualifications acquired in other EU countries are recognised without problems .
good health is an important issue for Europeans and their governments .
the EU is therefore at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of the efforts to protect and combat climate change .
since pollution does not feel borders , the EU has been working together for years in this area .
it is not surpris@@ ing that Europe &apos;s ri@@ vers and be@@ aches are clean@@ er , cars pollu@@ ting less and strict rules on waste management .
Europe &apos;s hazardous waste can no longer be transported to poor countries .
strict EU rules also apply to the safety of chemicals used by companies and the environment .
the EU aims to make transport , industry , agriculture and tourism work so that they do not destroy natural resources – in other words that development is sustainable .
in order to stop climate change , the EU has agreed on strict measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 .
energy is the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the EU &apos;s long-term climate policy and the EU has set binding targets for wind , hydro@@ - and solar energy and other clean renewable energy sources .
in addition to combating climate change , it helps to promote the economy and ensure more stable energy supply by reducing European dependence on foreign oil and gas imports .
the EU has already introduced an innovative emission trading scheme , thanks to which energy-@@ consum@@ ing companies can benefit from reducing energy consumption and are penal@@ ising companies crossing the borders .
the euro ( € ) is probably one of the EU &apos;s tangible achievements .
the single currency is in use in 16 countries in which more than two thirds of the EU population lives .
other countries will join when their economies are ready .
all Euro@@ s and euro coins can be used in all countries where the euro is a turnover .
the pa@@ per@@ work is the same everywhere , in the coins , but there is a common design on the other side of the country of origin .
the euro is a turnover in the following countries : Austria , Belgium , Spain , the Netherlands , Ireland , Italy , Greece , Cyprus , Luxembourg , Malta , Portugal , France , Germany , Slovakia , Slovenia , Finland and the United Kingdom .
our society is fa@@ irer and more efficient if we do not discrimin@@ ate against other people because of their nationality , gender , disability , race or other speci@@ fici@@ ties .
the EU therefore prohi@@ bits discrimination .
in the 19@@ 50@@ s , the first EU treaties contained a clear rule , men and women must receive equal pay for equal work .
it was a pi@@ one@@ er in the fight against women &apos;s rights and today they form an integral part of EU policy .
in order to combat cross-border crime and terrorism , the EU has taken steps to ensure the full cooperation of police and customs officials , migration agencies and courts .
one practical measure is the European Ar@@ rest War@@ rant , which facilita@@ tes the introduction of suspected persons from the country where they are arrested , the country in which their actions are to be examined and jud@@ ged .
EU countries also coordinate asylum policy and strengthen control at the EU &apos;s external borders .
as EU citizens have the right to live in all Member States , their rights must be protected in all EU countries .
Member State governments must ensure the uniform application of EU legislation and the enfor@@ ceability of judgments in other Member States .
the EU has greatly facilita@@ ted the problems of cross-border justice , such as marriage , separation , divorce and child care rights and other civil disputes .
new skills are needed and all we need to do is de@@ vote more time to learning .

the war between the EU countries is un@@ thin@@ kable today , thanks to the un@@ ity between countries over the past 50 years .
in view of this success , the EU now aims to promote peace and stability outside its borders .
the first and best way to avoid conflicts is to increase prosperity throughout the world .
the EU as the world &apos;s largest trading force uses its influence to establish fair rules in global trade .
the EU seeks to ensure that globalisation also benefits po@@ ore@@ r countries .
today , the EU will give more humanitarian aid and development aid as someone else .
the EU will send military and police missions to proble@@ matic regions such as the Balkans .
this is a political part of the EU &apos;s common foreign and security policy .
the European Union is an example of how to successfully comb@@ ine the economic and political resources of democratic countries in the common interest , as a model for other regions of the world .

he wasn &apos;t the only son of his father , even though he was the ol@@ dest , his brother William was on the side of the Cu@@ c@@ ko@@ ld in Cu@@ c@@ ko@@ ld and the green@@ houses near the Cu@@ c@@ ko@@ ld .
the M@@ uni@@ ci@@ pal@@ ity of M@@ uni@@ ci@@ pal@@ ity was found in many parts of the city , but the c@@ lan@@ s of Richard - who were believed to have mig@@ rated in the days of Wal@@ es - had lived here already enough generations to achieve a certain position in order to achieve a certain position of the cla@@ n .
Richard &apos;s father wasn &apos;t one of them .
after a brief study in primary school , he went to work at a din@@ er , and later , a free man who paid his fines , he tried to f@@ ry the pu@@ mp@@ kin .
it was also organised in a socially appropriate marriage ; Marga@@ ret B@@ ig@@ gs came from a prosper@@ ous family from B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , and brought together , among other things , reading litera@@ cy , even though he did not understand .
children , the first girl , you came to the weather with an adequate frequency , so the pain of a few deaths and gri@@ ef didn &apos;t cause .
if Dick learned to rule so much to pull out before e@@ jac@@ ula@@ ting , the number of children stayed with two living sons and three girls .
a family , and a little small enough to take care of it .
dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read as well as to write and his hopes focused on Richard when it became clear that two years younger William &apos;s scho@@ ol@@ boy .
so if Richard had become seven years old , he was the Col@@ ston Po@@ iss@@ ant Sch@@ ool and became a famous blue coat that proc@@ lai@@ med the b@@ ris@@ tol@@ ans that his father was poor , but his father is hon@@ or@@ able .
and in the subsequent five years , he was sta@@ mped with litera@@ cy and numer@@ acy .
he learned a hand@@ some hand to write , to calculate , che@@ w himself through Caesar &apos;s G@@ alli@@ a w@@ ars , C@@ ic@@ ero calls and the O@@ vi@@ di@@ us Me@@ ta@@ mor@@ pho@@ sis .
because he was a good student , even though he was far from distingu@@ ished , and he had a cour@@ tes@@ y of a fine art , he made it easy for Mr. Col@@ ston .
at the age of 12 , it was time to leave school and to find a business or an invitation to the education level .
for the great surprise of rela@@ tives , he didn &apos;t choose any of the bodies so far .
his biggest for@@ gi@@ veness turned out to be mechan@@ ics , assembly of things , and it was an admi@@ rable pati@@ ence for young man .
and on his own choice , he became a master at Master To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ t , who held a weapon of arms .
my father made a decision on a quiet jo@@ y , he was sen@@ ten@@ cing that one of Morgan@@ s gro@@ ws a hand@@ cra@@ cker , not a mer@@ ch@@ ant .
besides , the war was part of life and the war needed guns .
the man who made weapons and repa@@ ired the weapons didn &apos;t threa@@ ten a threat to the bat@@ tle@@ field .
for Ric@@ har@@ d , seven years of app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps were app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip and learning time , although it was a little mo@@ dest for physical pleasure .
like the other boys , he was working , living in the family &apos;s house , served him at the dinner table , filled the stomach with lef@@ to@@ vers and slept on the floor .
fortuna@@ tely , Master To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was a good host and even a better gun .
although he was able to prepare the beautiful du@@ el pist@@ ols and hunting rif@@ les , he had enough to understand that they had to be in Man@@ ton , but Man@@ ton couldn &apos;t be in Man@@ ton .
so was his work on war mus@@ kets , spo@@ t@@ len@@ tly called &quot; B@@ essi@@ x B@@ essi@@ x &quot; called 4@@ 6-@@ dus@@ ty beau@@ ties , iron cu@@ ps , and still pe@@ anu@@ t bro@@ wn hair .
at the age of 19 , Richard received a mas@@ ter@@ piece and moved out of the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ t household , but not his work@@ shop .
he continued to work on the P@@ ru@@ un@@ s B@@ es@@ side .
and he married , as long as the app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip of the ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce was turned around .
the wife of her mother was his mother &apos;s daughter , but that the English church had no objection to this , his girlfriend at the al@@ tar of the bri@@ de James James .
marriage was arran@@ ged , but there was a lot of love between the spo@@ uses during the years .
although there was some confusion about the son of Richard Morgan and Marga@@ ret Bri@@ g@@ gs , Richard Morgan , the son of Marga@@ ret Bri@@ g@@ gs was a woman .
until the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s Ar@@ med Ar@@ my worked , there was nothing strange , because the young couple lived in a re@@ p@@ ent ren@@ tal at the Temp@@ le of Av@@ oni Street , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s from the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ t .
the marriage was signed in 17@@ 67 , three years after the end of the se@@ ven@@ -@@ year war with France ; despite the victory in debt , Britain was forced to increase revenue to increase revenue , and to dra@@ matically tigh@@ ten the money .
the weapons were no longer needed , the mas@@ ters and the students at the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ t , until the entire company consis@@ ted of Richard and Lord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s himself .
and then , for a while after Little Mary was born in 17@@ 70 , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant to let Richard be shot .
&quot; come to work for me , &quot; Dick Morgan was kind@@ ly .
&quot; the weapons come and go , but the rum remains . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened , despite the problem .
Richard &apos;s mother was always invited brief@@ ly to Ma@@ g and Richard &apos;s wife Pe@@ g , both from Marga@@ ret .
the bigger problem , however , was that all men in England , except for the pro@@ gen@@ y of ro@@ cks , who were cro@@ ssed into C@@ ran@@ fi@@ el@@ ds and O@@ ne@@ si@@ ph@@ or@@ us were either John , William , Henry , Richard , James or Thomas .
it was one of the few practices that fit everyone in the King &apos;s be@@ aches .
&amp; quot ; This is the first time I see this . &amp; quot ;
it called a di@@ ver in a di@@ ver , who was just so@@ ak@@ ed up in the s@@ tern of the research ship and barely got word from the mouth .
after the lad@@ der has sw@@ allowed , he took the lea@@ k and the mask and passed them to the waiting ferry .
then he dra@@ gged himself out of the water , losing a balance under the weight of the cy@@ lin@@ ders .
the moment was surroun@@ ded by other crew members who were already waiting on the di@@ ve deck .
Jack Howard stepped down from the captain and s@@ mi@@ led a friend .
he still couldn &apos;t believe that this bo@@ dy@@ man could move so much from the water under@@ water .
on deck , the di@@ ving gear lying down on deck opened his mouth , a friend of mine over the years .
&quot; and we thought you &apos;d swi@@ m back to Ath@@ ens and sit in the gin and ton@@ ic with your father &apos;s pool . &quot;
the study is not based on solid qualitative data , forecasts or personal opinions , but has been assemb@@ led from many sources , including inter@@ views , general studies , trends and hearing .
all data prior to 1990 will be based on inter@@ views and online search for numerous news@@ papers , television and radio news@@ papers , more specifically in search of information collection methods used earlier .
the schedule for the period after 1998 is based on everything that has taken place over the last 11 years and I have read about 1000 different studies .
the schedule for 2009 and the following years is based on the forecasts of me and others for the years ahead .
the gra@@ ph@@ s are not pre@@ requ@@ isi@@ tes for 100 % accuracy , their aim is to out@@ line the evolution of the situation and to out@@ line the social media news , targeted communication and other such future .
the article aims to make people think .
we are now seeing a completely novel way of communic@@ ating with people , which makes traditional ways simp@@ ler .
this is a fundamental change that makes the world , which we feel , completely .
the best thing about this is that you can make it happen .
come with me to the last 2@@ 10-@@ year of information sources , plus a gli@@ mp@@ se of the next ten .
before we start expl@@ oring the future , we &apos;ll see how we made it to the day we go back to 18@@ 00 , where finding information was different .
in the 18@@ 00@@ s , people came out to talk to people and meet them .
everything was fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face communication .
for the sale of the product , you should have gone to the local market and the only possibility to communicate in general , was to meet personal or set sales table .
this meant for you to be in the right place in order to obtain information or to give it .
you didn &apos;t know what was going on in another part of the city , and couldn &apos;t sell your products to the people in another place .
they talked about a novel concept called news@@ paper ...
by 19@@ 00 , news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines have changed communication , enabling us to get news where we never had been .
we got our ideas to people we never saw , and sell our products to others who were far away .
we were supposed to go out and talk to other people , but we got to be aware of our own town .
it was un@@ believable , the first real re@@ volution .
the world started to open .
since 19@@ 20 , the new source of people &apos;s attention - the radio .
suddenly , the voice of another person has been heard from hundreds of miles .
but most import@@ antly , the latest information was possible in real time .
it was the next huge development in history .
however , the radio development time meant that until 19@@ 60 , the news@@ papers domin@@ ated the news@@ papers .
if you wanted to get the latest news or introduce your product , you &apos;d have used the news@@ paper .
it seemed to be a very large source of information .
this situation started to change in 19@@ 60 .
the radio reached and two main sources of information were broad@@ cast in real time news on radio and news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines .
it was a great time for the media , although some said that &amp; quot ; the news@@ papers could compete with the radio , better news@@ papers &amp; quot ; - an argument that we could hear repeatedly for 50 years .
over the next 40 years , the next technology re@@ volution was introduced .
it started to collect public interest in the 19@@ 50@@ s and the beginning of the 199@@ 0s was a big , van@@ qu@@ ished news@@ paper and maga@@ z@@ ines , but still domin@@ ated radio .
now people get information as well as watching .
the years 197@@ 0s were also time when publish@@ ers of news@@ papers realized that something was horri@@ bly wrong with their sales market .
they had a lot of problems with the radio race , but television was another class .
only eight years later and television was domin@@ ated by the information world , the radio was almost only the ‘ place of free music ’ and the news@@ papers did everything that could be able to survive .
the constant development of technology continued with persis@@ tence , never seen before .
the new phenomenon was in the sha@@ dows : the Internet .
1998 was the year when the Internet changed from a strange place , which had not much significance , un@@ question@@ ably important , bringing the attitude that every company must have a website .
the re@@ volution has started three years earlier , but in 1998 it reached critical mass and tried to draw attention to all the attention , despite the relatively low and most people being deprived of access .
however , all that it was the future - the start of a new era .
it was where everyone could have gotten information everywhere - at least theory .
people started to realize the Internet was more than just information .
by joining the conversation , you got something back and being part of it instead of being a monitor .
however , the most important thing was to choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it .
Internet opportunities were ir@@ rever@@ sible .
in 2004 , only six years later , the Internet had changed how we were dealing with information .
however , television and news@@ papers domin@@ ated our news sources , but the new@@ est world was definitely on the Internet .
people made new websites and discovered online applications .
people were able to do so much and participate in so many areas in order to show a new concept : the over@@ load of information .
for the first time in my life , we were in contact with more information than we could absor@@ b .
in the news@@ papers , we had to choose what we wanted to see .
in 2004 we had to choose what we did not want to see .
it had a disas@@ tro@@ us impact on the traditional image of the information .
in the past , it was possible to get people &apos;s attention simply by doing something .
people wanted more choice , so they just had to give them a new option .
in 2004 , this changed because it was not enough to do something different : it had to be better .
2004 was also a year when another phenomenon began to emer@@ ge : social networks .
this concept was qui@@ et@@ ly collected by blo@@ gs .
it was easy for everyone , easy and accessible to share our ideas .
for the first time , everyone had a chance to create their own own information , without doing anything technical .
the handling of information became a tool tool for all tools .
three years later and the social element of the Internet , when the voice of the powerful people actually is .
for the first time , television was no longer the main source of information and the news@@ papers fought for survival .
everyone wanted to create a little world and connect it to his friends .
2007 was also a turning point for traditional websites that people compared with news@@ papers - in static and pas@@ sive form .
we wanted an active information .
we wanted to be part of this , not just to look at it .
blo@@ gs started to get into trouble .
as television has eliminated the radio ( because it was better and more ri@@ cher for people to provide information on the ra@@ dar ) , the social networks removed the blo@@ gs .
the social profile is more active for people to share what they care about .
social networks are just better for this and blo@@ gs can &apos;t stay behind it .
two years later , today , the new Internet is domin@@ ating our world .
news@@ papers are dead in water and people are watching less television than ever .
we are new k@@ ings , using the tools of social networks to contact and communicate .
even a traditional website will die , which has been killed by a continuous flow of information from the social networks .
over the last 210 years we have seen amazing development how we can get information .
the main steps are :
getting out of the remote places .
it &apos;s getting in real time .
3 , seeing it in real time .
4 . decide when to watch and watch .
5 .
6 .
being a source of information .
2009 is the beginning of the next re@@ volution .
all we know is changing .
the first and most dra@@ matic change is the concept of social news .
it will quickly take over our need to know what happens in the world .
the news will no longer be transmitted by journalists , because now it comes from everyone .
they will be transmitted directly from the source , leaving traditional media .
instead of the journal@@ ist , what analy@@ sts say , you hear that from the analy@@ st .
social news gets news from the source right and cen@@ sor@@ ship .
a new enter@@ tainment wave is emerging ( light blue and pur@@ ple areas ) domin@@ ated by games , video and sound flows .
instead of playing a TV channel , you decide what you want to look at and when you want to watch it .
we no longer join the channels where someone else decides what we can look at .
you &apos;re checking all the experience .
in the form of information , the new concept is slowly rising .
we already see a growing number of mobile phone services that provide local information on this area where you are located .
instead , instead of showing all the restaur@@ ants in the world , the phone only shows the list in your area .
it &apos;s something that will explo@@ de in the next few years .
in the world where we have access to more information than we can consu@@ me , it is a very important element of obtaining relevant information , extending much further to the simple location that we see today .
over the next five or ten years , the information world will change .
all traditional forms will eventually die .
printed news@@ papers no longer exist , television in the form of current channels replaced by individual programmes that you can look at when you want .
radio broadcas@@ ts are intended to replace the po@@ ckets and video broadcas@@ ts .
websites have a much smaller role to play - their primary function is the distribution of activities that can be done elsewhere , becoming a place where people can use raw materials elsewhere .
many websites and communication networks join one .
social news , as described above , will preva@@ il as to how people intera@@ ct .
the traditional press will be fully replaced because people get information directly from the source .
everyone is a potential repor@@ ter , but the new advantages of the use of target groups will eliminate most of the pois@@ on .
journalists become ed@@ itors who instead have the news , bringing them together , giving us a bigger picture .
the future news flow is person@@ alised and it &apos;s constantly changing according to what you look at , the same way L@@ ast@@ .@@ f@@ m does music today .
all form the target group .
you have control over each individual information that moves towards you .
two new concepts are emerging in 2010 .
one of them is intelligent information where information flows can involve some of the various sources of news , not just pulling data , but by bringing it together , by sharing it and issuing valuable parts .
instead of reading the five different articles of the same subject , you will be given one , highlighting important interest points .
how secure are your Christmas lights ?
EU tests show serious risks to the electric shock and fire resistance .
stay safe , turn them off when you go to bed or exit the house .
the market investigation carried out by the Commission has pointed out that every third series of Christmas lights had direct fire safety or electric shock .
the tests were carried out in Germany , Hungary , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia with nearly 200 sheep sets of all price categories .
samples were checked over more than 20 requirements and many fell through more than one test .
the Commission found a large number of sheep , weaknesses and poor insu@@ lation in many sheep .
only 40 % of samples were made in China .
in Hungary , almost 96 % of the lamps are dangerous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % did not reply to EU security standards .
although only five countries took part in the study , it is likely that the same lamps are sold across the EU .
Commissioner for Consumer Protection Mag@@ len@@ a K@@ une@@ va said that the results were wa@@ king up .
he ur@@ ged EU Member States to work better on security requirements and said that industry ( producers , retai@@ lers , retai@@ lers and importers ) should also make control more effective .
for customers , he stressed the vigilance of the following :
in Stockholm , some 4 000 participants are expected to take part in the Stockholm event , which will be presented to the EU &apos;s efforts to make development more effective .
the general theme &amp; quot ; citizens and development &amp; quot ; will focus on the impact of this year on the economic down@@ turn in global warming and po@@ ore@@ r countries .
although they are usually the last ones to blame , these countries are particularly affected by both economic down@@ turn and climate change .
rising levels of sea level , de@@ serti@@ fication and increased and more serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and un@@ prec@@ eden@@ ted development goals .
and the current economic climate has led to a reduction in assisting don@@ ations for developing countries , reducing food guarantees in the already vulnerable regions .
in bringing together politicians , public officials , NGOs , business leaders , acade@@ mics , acade@@ mics and media , the European Development Da@@ ys offer the opportunity to establish relations , sharing experiences and find new partners for development projects .
three days , which starts on 22 October , includes training , discussion platforms and work@@ shops .
&amp; quot ; Development village &amp; quot ; offers organisations the opportunity to present themselves to dele@@ gates and to the public and to raise awareness of their objectives .
a number of development pri@@ zes are shared , including the Lor@@ enzo Na@@ ta@@ li Prize for Human Rights , for the outstanding presentation of human rights , democracy and development challenges .
the youth development premium goes for teen@@ ag@@ ers or vide@@ os showing human development in Africa .
on October , the EU will also make the first European progress report on the matter .
this represents an EU approach to the EU approach to ‘ Ha@@ b@@ ras@@ ts ’ in sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa .
the EU will provide more than half of all development aid .
the donors &apos; conference will send strong signals to support Georgia .
until later , Georgia was the fas@@ test growing economy in the world in Georgia , 12 % in 2007 .
this change in the short , but inten@@ se conflict with Russia in August .
key transport lines and u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties were damaged , buildings and houses turned into rock bu@@ b@@ bles and bom@@ bs destroyed large forest areas .
more than two months later , many foreign investors have left , tour@@ ists have disappeared , unemployment has ris@@ en and many ge@@ or@@ gi@@ ans have emp@@ tied their bank accounts .
the World Bank now predi@@ cts that Georgia , the gate of energy sources to Europe needs EUR 2.4 billion to recover .
over the next three years , the EU has allocated EUR 500 million and the US has promised EUR 7@@ 57 million ( 1 billion dollars ) over half of this year .
the EU and the World Bank ho@@ s@@ ted the donors &apos; conference on 22 October to meet the remaining EUR 1.1 billion .
the event was invited to nearly 70 countries and the institution .
the aid will support reconstruction and help the Georgi@@ an Government to meet the first needs of those people who had to fle@@ e their homes .
tens of thousands of people were re@@ settled , many of them still find shel@@ ter in temporary refugee centres .
but the lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term objective is to restore the Georgia economy , which has been undergoing major changes in recent years .
&amp; quot ; It is important that the crisis does not lead Georgia to political and economic reforms , which are now more important than the summer of the conflict &quot; said Commissioner Ferre@@ ro-@@ Wald@@ ner .
the former So@@ vi@@ et Republic will normally receive around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union .
between Georgia and Russia , there are differences between South Os@@ se@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ haz@@ ia - two broke the Georgi@@ an provin@@ ce , which Russia recognises as independent countries .
the first round of peace talks in Geneva on 15 October and talks will continue under the aus@@ pic@@ es of the UN and the European medi@@ ators in November .
it allowed EU observers to move to the ce@@ ase@@ fire to monitor the ce@@ ase@@ fire .
thousands of Russian soldiers remain in separ@@ at@@ ist areas .
the European mus@@ ici@@ ans were hon@@ oured for a well-@@ selling de@@ but .
ten new stars share the spo@@ t@@ light on this year &apos;s European B@@ order B@@ rea@@ kers A@@ wards .
while acknowle@@ dging progress towards reaching wider audi@@ ences , European A@@ wards are for mus@@ ici@@ ans whose bu@@ b@@ bles are well sold in the European Union ( except their country ) .
the win@@ ners of this year are some of the hot@@ test names of the European music landscap@@ e - A@@ dele ( UK ) , Al@@ pha@@ beat ( Denmark ) , Aaron ( France ) , C@@ ine@@ ma Bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re ( Germany ) , The D@@ ø@@ pt Bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re ( Germany ) , the S@@ cri@@ pt ( Sweden ) , the S@@ cri@@ pt ( Sweden ) , the S@@ cri@@ pt ( Sweden ) , the S@@ cri@@ pt ( Sweden ) , the S@@ cri@@ pt .
the pri@@ zes are awarded to the opening evening of the Euro@@ son@@ ic No@@ order@@ sla@@ g music f@@ esti@@ val in the Dutch city of G@@ ron@@ ing@@ en , which will also be transferred on television .
the event , which includes presen@@ tations of current and previous win@@ ners , is the evening of the British TV character Jo@@ ols Holland .
now , in your sixth year , the prize is international success and the support of the European music industry , which provides some 600 000 people .
the former win@@ ners are now known ar@@ tists like Car@@ la Br@@ uni , To@@ k@@ o Ho@@ tel , Da@@ mi@@ en R@@ ice , The Fra@@ tel@@ lis and Gabriel Ri@@ os , a s@@ inger born in Pu@@ er@@ to Ric@@ o .
he is present at the cere@@ mony of this year , which is recorded and entered in re@@ al-@@ time EB@@ U T@@ V@@ s on Saturday , 17 January , beginning at 20 : 15 ( C@@ ET ) .
one of the win@@ ners of the last year was Finland &apos;s rock band at Sun@@ rise Avenue , which was victory for the Wa@@ y to W@@ on@@ der@@ land albu@@ m .
Mik@@ ko Sau@@ k@@ kon@@ en , the campaign campaign campaign for Bon@@ nier A@@ mig@@ o , says the prize is a group that is currently recording a second albu@@ m .
&amp; quot ; We are very certain that this will help in the future of the band . &amp; quot ;
the 2008 C@@ annes f@@ esti@@ val shows the success of EU-@@ funded films in the world .
four@@ teen film , which has partly supported the EU media programme , has been selected in 61 International F@@ il@@ m F@@ esti@@ val F@@ esti@@ val .
in film f@@ esti@@ vals , EU-@@ funded production is no longer a stran@@ ger and has seen millions of people over years .
the EU media programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of the continent through the film .
however , European film makers face major challenges both internationally and at home .
in the 19@@ th May , during the Sixth European Day in C@@ annes , representatives of the EU are sitting together with European film ministers and with producers to discuss how to stimulate the audiovisual industry to greater international cooperation .
the aim is to extend the circulation of content to other parts of the world and to cooperate more closely with other film industries outside the EU .
such an international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films .
the C@@ annes F@@ esti@@ val of last year contained some of the film financed by the EU media programme .
and at the beginning of this year several EU films were presented ( e.g. The counterfe@@ i@@ ters and La M@@ ô@@ me ) O@@ sc@@ ars .
14 EU funded films in C@@ annes 2008 were : G@@ om@@ orra , Del@@ ta , La fron@@ ti@@ ère de l &apos;@@ au@@ be de Lor@@ na , The Pal@@ er@@ mo S@@ hoo@@ ting , The Pal@@ er@@ mo S@@ hoo@@ ting , San@@ gue pa@@ zzo , Sal@@ am@@ and@@ ra , El@@ è@@ ve lib@@ re , Sal@@ am@@ ve lib@@ re , The Pal@@ er@@ mo S@@ hoo@@ ting , The Pal@@ er@@ mo lib@@ re , Sal@@ am@@ and@@ ra .
at the EU-@@ China Summit in Pra@@ gue on 20 May , the main themes were climate change , financial crisis and economic relations .
the EU and China signed agreements to extend cooperation with science and technology , clean energy and small business .
again , they reaffir@@ med their commitment to the project to develop technology to produce electricity from coal un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling - one basic gas that is the cause of global warming .
two sides discussed the views of the international climate change debate in Copenhagen in December .
the EU encourages emerging economies such as China to limit CO2 emissions by offering financial support from developed countries .
with regard to the financial crisis , the EU and China agreed that international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic risks and on rising and emerging economies should have more say in these institutions .
in May , two sides highlighted trade and investment as keys to economic recovery .
two sides also discussed the human rights situation in Ti@@ bet and conflict in Sri Lanka , Afghanistan and Pakistan - three countries in which China has a significant impact .
on Tuesday 15 December , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Estonia , Andr@@ us An@@ si@@ pi@@ le , expres@@ sing his con@@ dol@@ ences to the Estonian people and the Prime Minister in Afghanistan .
in his con@@ dol@@ ences , Prime Minister emp@@ h@@ asi@@ zed that the death of a soldier is a major loss for the victim &apos;s family and all Estonia .
today , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis and Minister for Agriculture J@@ ā@@ nis D@@ Ū@@ K@@ LA@@ V@@ S held the heli@@ cop@@ ter of the Estonian Minister for Agriculture - Val@@ dor Se@@ ed@@ er , the Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture , Kaz@@ ys ST@@ AR@@ K@@ EV@@ I@@ Č@@ I@@ US , and the Minister for Agriculture and Food of Belarus .
the Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture , J@@ ā@@ nis D@@ Ū@@ K@@ LA@@ V@@ S , announced four countries , signed today and which creates better conditions for their cooperation in agriculture .
it is based on equality and mutual benefits by harmon@@ ising legislation and by exchange of information and practical projects .
the Prime Minister stressed : &amp; quot ; Memor@@ andu@@ m , which was signed today , promotes cooperation in a very important area for the economy of all four countries .
Mr Se@@ my@@ on S@@ hap@@ iro , Minister for Agriculture and Food , than@@ ked Mr D@@ ū@@ kla@@ v for the initiative of the Minister for Agriculture in Min@@ sk , which was out of his visit to Min@@ sk to bring together ministers for agriculture in the Baltic States and Belarus , not just to discuss the problems and the current events in this area .
the Belar@@ usi@@ an Minister for Agriculture and Food said that Belarus has extensive practical experience in the production of agricultural machinery and that the country would be interested in creating joint undertakings with Latvia .
Minister S@@ hap@@ iro called for professional farmers in Latvia and other Baltic States to provide practical experience in the certification of companies producing agricultural products and agricultural machinery to ensure the sale of agricultural products in Belarus on the EU market .
the Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture Kaz@@ ys ST@@ AR@@ K@@ EV@@ I@@ Č@@ I@@ US expressed his gra@@ titude for active mutual cooperation in agriculture and fisheries in the European Union between three Baltic States , Finland and Poland , but a new model of cooperation between the three Baltic States and Belarus was launched today .
the Czech Minister for Agriculture - Val@@ dor Se@@ e@@ der stressed that Latvia is currently active in the field of agriculture , which is likely to grow .
the Minister also announced that there were three main priorities in Estonia &apos;s budget for the next year , one of them .
on Wednesday , 9 December in Bon@@ n , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis received a private enterprise policy for the European People &apos;s Party for the promotion of private enterprise policy .
the prize was awarded by the President of the SME Union , Peter Jun@@ gen , who stressed that the main objective of the prize was to shape EU policies more in a more SME@@ -@@ friendly way .
the Lat@@ vian Prime Minister than@@ ked the SME Uni@@ on for its recognition and the contribution made to developing an investment friendly and efficient business environment in Europe .
V. Dom@@ bro@@ vskis stressed that the SME network had contributed to the idea of introducing micro-@@ economic support measures in Latvia .
the Lat@@ vian Government has taken steps not only to ensure fiscal sustainability , but has also developed a support programme for the micro-@@ economy in Latvia aimed at reducing barriers to micro-@@ economic activity and encouraging unemployed people to start their business .
in order to achieve the objective , the government has adopted a decision to reduce the requirements of company free capital and registration costs , simplified tax information and accounting procedures and ensure financial support for micro-@@ economic activities .
in his speech , the Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are a driving force for the economy , contributing to the decline in unemployment , long-term development and stability .
we have already announced that on the dates 8-@@ 10 December , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis will attend the Con@@ gress of the European People &apos;s Party in Bon@@ n , Germany .
the reform group of reforms has agreed on an inter@@ connected communication that is already signed on Monday 2 November .
the exchange of information corresponds to the model of cooperation established by the government and non-governmental bodies representing shared responsibility for socio-economic situations in the country , Latvia &apos;s international commitments and their impact on future developments .
the reform group has set priorities for these tasks focusing directly on the competitiveness , growth and recovery of the country &apos;s economy .
the group stresses that the assessment of the combined key functions carried out and the ra@@ tional use of potential public budgets has made progress in determining the reduction of funding according to the performance of tasks and the assessment of functions aimed at reducing line@@ ar financing .
although agreement was reached on objectives - small and efficient administration , expansion of internal and external markets for the Lat@@ vian economy and promoting employment - shared the general opinion of the need to continue to work towards a clearer framework for future structural reforms .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ administration Group believes that it is necessary to continue the active introduction of social security measures , which are included in the economic recovery plans aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and attra@@ cting investment , measures to support the launch of micro-@@ economic activities and business star@@ t-@@ ups , in-depth public administration functions , spe@@ eding up the assessment methodology and the introduction of the principle .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ administration Group has accepted the need to speed up the introduction of EU programmes , which have been delayed in the current period of five years , and the group will also consider that the average budget should be implemented by linking the budget to the operational and development budget by linking the external market to future development priorities .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ administration group was established in July 2009 with a view to ensuring public participation in the budget reduction and decision-making .
on 26 and 27 November , the International Conference in R@@ iga was an international conference in the European Union .
Latvia and Estonia agree jointly to rent a diplomatic mission for the territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt .
as from 1 January 2010 , Latvia and Estonia are working together in the ren@@ ted complex in the Arab Republic of Egypt , opti@@ mising their administrative costs .
this agreement was reached between Mr Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ stin@@ s and Mr Ur@@ mas Pa@@ et , Minister for Foreign Affairs , during his official visit to Ri@@ iga on 18 February this year , and ended with the next talks between Foreign Ministers .
this initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Baltic States in the light of the Presid@@ en@@ cy-@@ in-Office of the Baltic Council , in which Latvia is taking the same projects in the future in 2010 .
the Lat@@ vian E@@ mb@@ ass@@ y in C@@ air@@ o has acted since 2007 , officially opened in March 2009 during the visit of Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ stin@@ s to Egypt .
since 2010 , the Estonian representation in Egypt takes place on premises which are ren@@ ted together with Latvia .
Latvia is represented by Mar@@ is Sel@@ f in the Arab Republic of Egypt .
Mr Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ stin@@ s , Minister for Foreign Affairs , called on the Russian Foreign Minister to find a quick solution to the situation of freight carriers at the border of Latvia .
the report calls on the Council of Ministers to discuss the outcome of the negotiations on relations between the two parties in 2009 , as well as the current developments in the situation of freight carriers in Latvia .
both foreign ministers share the view that the situation of mutual relations in this year can generally be assessed posi@@ tively .
next , ministers reviewed the agenda for the forthcoming year of EU-Russia relations , including further improvements in the legal framework , such as a number of important agreements between several governments .
Ministers , RI@@ EK@@ S and La@@ vro@@ v , also discussed the current state of freight transport in Latvia and Russia at the border .
because of the increased customs control of the Russian Federation , the situation in Latvia is dra@@ matic , and the long transport truck from Latvia is needed to get a swi@@ ft solution , because this is causing significant losses in the telephone conversation .
Ministers agreed that the respective institutions of both countries , including the Lat@@ vi@@ jas Road Transport Association , should continue to make efforts to nor@@ mal@@ ise the situation in the near future , according to the agreement reached by the Inter@@ governmental Pan@@ el on Transport on 18 December .

I recently ordered a new pair of shoes ( commodity code # 6@@ 54@@ 29@@ 51 ) on your website on 21 June .
I got the order on June 26 .
unfortunately , when I opened it , I saw the shoes were used .
the shoes were all so@@ ils and a little tea@@ r was part of that part of the front toe .
my order number is AF@@ 26@@ 16@@ 8@@ 156 .
to solve the problem , I would like you to take over my account , which was asked for their shoes .
I &apos;ve already gone and bought a new pair of shoes from the local sports store , so as a result of sending another pair , I would have two pair of shoes .
thank you for reading this letter .

we would like to invite you to attend a special event that will take place at our school .
your coming would honor us .
please respond by Monday , 26 February , to confirm your presence .
we &apos;re hoping to see you here ,
sin@@ ce@@ rely , Susan Harris .
in 2007 , the most powerful partic@@ le accele@@ ra@@ tor of the partic@@ le accele@@ ra@@ tor , the new Lar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der col@@ li@@ der , measure predominantly the state of energy in the matter of the matter .
by allowing them to col@@ lide , if they move close to the speed of light , scientists hope to find information about the historical forms , using the energy that has been released for that impact .
what is it expected of the large investment that Europe has done to produce L@@ H@@ C ?
it s@@ ends two pro@@ ton spe@@ eds , partic@@ les formed by at@@ om@@ ic core and belonging to the partic@@ le family , in different direc@@ tions with a lon@@ ger@@ -@@ circu@@ lar under@@ ground tunnel .
in order to speed up the pro@@ tons and to ensure their closure of a nar@@ row beam , strong magnetic fields are required . these fields are generated by super@@ conduc@@ tors , materials capable of driving electricity without barriers or energy loss and which are produced in cooperation with European industry .
pro@@ ton col@@ lis@@ ion will take place at a speed of eight deci@@ mal millions per second of an enormous energy volume of 14 TE@@ V .
to understand the size of this magni@@ tude , 1 TE@@ V is about the amount of energy used to move to the mo@@ squ@@ i@@ to .
but in the L@@ H@@ C , the amount of energy will be concentrated one million times smaller than this bu@@ g .
as energy can be transferred to partic@@ les in accordance with the principle of mass energy equival@@ ence ( E = m@@ c@@ 2 ) , physi@@ cs are expected to create partic@@ les that have never been considered in the accele@@ ra@@ tors .
the frequency and intensity of col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons are important as they make it possible to see the partic@@ les of partic@@ les more visible .
there are two main nuclear spe@@ eds that energy c@@ and@@ les with 1 150 Te@@ v , but fewer col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons per second .
for search super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ a ...
certain sen@@ sors are capable of analy@@ sing the impact .
the two names are C@@ MS ( Com@@ pac@@ t Mu@@ on Sol@@ en@@ oid ) and At@@ las ( A To@@ ro@@ ida@@ l L@@ H@@ C Ap@@ para@@ tus ) .
they focus on detection of super@@ sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal partic@@ les and Higgins .
what &apos;s super sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ?
partic@@ le physi@@ cs contains several sy@@ m@@ me@@ tries , such as matter and anti@@ matter .
Super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try bin@@ ds fer@@ mi@@ on ( construction material for the matter , such as elec@@ tr@@ ons and quar@@ ries ) with each boss ( channel@@ led through the transfer , such as fo@@ il ) and vice ver@@ sa .
the challenge is that the super@@ flu@@ ous sy@@ m@@ me@@ try of the anti@@ partic@@ les has never been seen before .
how do you detect them ?
par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , through their absence !
&quot; it &apos;s a little like being a movie .
you count the number of in@@ coming and out@@ going people .
if any person is missing at the end , because you know who entered , guess who did not . ”
the same way , the L@@ H@@ C examin@@ ers know that , as a result of certain clas@@ hes , these anti@@ partic@@ les should arise , which are in@@ visible to all sen@@ sors .
before the col@@ lis@@ ion of partic@@ le energy , they shall compare the energy of the partic@@ les after the col@@ lis@@ ion .
if there are differences in energy , a part has escap@@ ed .
by calculating the missing energy , they know whether or not the super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try component is involved .
the second challenge of c@@ ms and L@@ HS dete@@ ctors is the detection of the bos@@ ses of Higgins .
as regards the focus of the standard model theory , it is expected that it should be inter@@ change@@ able and give them mass .
how ?
suppose there &apos;s a to@@ wel@@ s of physi@@ cs .
suddenly , Albert E@@ inste@@ in comes in , students gather around him and start bom@@ bing her questions .
if Albert tries to move , he &apos;ll know a certain iner@@ tia for students sta@@ mping on him .
he &apos;s similar to those parts of the Hig@@ gs &apos; bos@@ ses trying to intera@@ ct with them - they collect mass .
here too , the anticipated detection of their famous bos@@ ses can only be indirect : partic@@ les that arise as a result of their degradation , they are the ones discovered .
K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ glu@@ on sou@@ p
the third sen@@ sor that L@@ H@@ C is equipped with is called Alice ( a large ion wave experi@@ ment ) .
it aims to detect parts of unknown nuclear physi@@ cs , especially the matter of matter , which exis@@ ted within a very short time after the Great P@@ au@@ ku , and what known as the quar@@ ter@@ back .
what is the new speci@@ ality ?
in the 19@@ 60@@ s , scientists realized that pro@@ ton and neutr@@ ali@@ zed , which formed the nuclear core of the at@@ om , were made even more of the original partic@@ les .
these blocks are strong forces ( which are directed by the partic@@ les called glu@@ on ) .
one of their own is that they are diverse together : they are always either in pa@@ irs or tri@@ bes ; they cannot exist alone .
the more you try to separate the K@@ var@@ k from another quarter , the greater the strength that keeps them together , making them permanent .
they say they &apos;re in prison .
however , if the pro@@ tons are to be bom@@ bed against each other , the sou@@ p and the sou@@ p containing the blocks will be created , which is free to move freely .
then we can refer to the release of quar@@ ter-@@ glu@@ on sou@@ p .
what kind of release ?
&amp; quot ; This is somewhat comparable to ski@@ ing .
if there is not much s@@ now , the tra@@ cks may be separated by gras@@ s and ski@@ ers are limited to their facility .
on the other hand , if there &apos;s a lot of s@@ now , they can change the path .
they are free from restrictions . &amp; quot ;
instead of the s@@ now , physi@@ cs include energy : the higher the quarterly energy , the weak@@ er power is , therefore , a high level of energy .
the plasma presence of K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ glu@@ on was probably one micro@@ seconds after the Great P@@ au@@ ku .
this is why physi@@ c@@ ists want to investigate the ion ir@@ ons created by the L@@ H@@ C .
by nature , they are very rich in pro@@ ton and neutr@@ on .
they can achieve energy 1 150 TE@@ V , which is necessary for quarterly glu@@ on plasma , which was un@@ prec@@ eden@@ ted at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse , to create and investigate .
anti@@ matter my@@ ster@@ y
finally , the last sen@@ sor called L@@ HC@@ b ( a great H@@ ad@@ ron accele@@ ra@@ tor ) .
its task is to better monitor the small differences between ma@@ matter and anti@@ matter , so that better understanding of what happened to the anti@@ matter of the universe .
for each part , the anti@@ do@@ te is the same as that of other properties , but the counter@@ -@@ charge .
therefore , a level playing field for electronic compu@@ ters is available , but the anti@@ electrical power ( or posi@@ tioning ) corresponding to a positive loan .
if the electricity and the anti@@ electric power are together , they will destroy each other , result in a energy supply .
in accordance with the standard model for partic@@ le physi@@ cs , an equal quantity of matter and anti@@ matter is created at the beginning of the universe .
consequently , all partic@@ les should destroy each other and the universe should be empty .
however , as anyone can see , there is a lot of matter .
this is a place where this question is to be followed by what L@@ HC@@ b is trying to answer : where is anti@@ matter ?
one possible response is based on the ability of certain partic@@ les to alter themselves as their anti@@ ques and vice ver@@ sa .
in this case , the existence of the matter depends on the hypo@@ the@@ sis ( a@@ waiting proof ) that the transformation of anti@@ partic@@ les into partic@@ les is dependent on the opposite transformation at the beginning of the universe .
can this im@@ balance be demonstrated ?
this is actually an experi@@ mental type of partic@@ le type , which is called the a@@ th@@ le@@ tes .
the An@@ tic@@ a@@ ons are spon@@ taneously trans@@ formed into the on@@ board , but the opposite is much less frequent .
L@@ HC@@ b is investi@@ gating another candidate , B bee@@ kee@@ per , containing ( among other things ) an element ( or its anti@@ component ) , which is called B-@@ block or dec@@ or@@ ating ( where the char@@ ming name is also required ) .
although the partic@@ les can &apos;t be seen , they can be detected .
for this purpose , L@@ H@@ C is equipped with equipment containing a number of con@@ cen@@ tric la@@ yers ( such as oni@@ on ) surroun@@ ded by partic@@ le speed where the impact occurs .
every la@@ yer speci@@ ali@@ zes in dete@@ cting a certain type of thing .
in the mid@@ st of the sen@@ sor , there are millions of se@@ mi@@ conduc@@ tors inside that chamber that produce power pul@@ se when a part goes against .
these impul@@ ses are recorded by compu@@ ters .
there &apos;s a magnetic field inside every sen@@ sor .
this will help detect and investigate the tra@@ jec@@ tory of partic@@ le partic@@ les ( e.g. electric or pro@@ ton ) which are sensitive to magnetic field .
the second device is a cal@@ ori@@ fic device .
some cal@@ ories stop partic@@ les like phot@@ ons or elec@@ tr@@ ons , but others are designed to stop neutr@@ ons and phot@@ ons .
they measure the partic@@ le energy loss .
aid from st@@ ring
how to define the nature of the Al@@ gos in iso@@ lation from mechanisms leading to their creation ?
after the standard model of the partic@@ le physi@@ cs ( resulting in qu@@ an@@ tum mechan@@ ics ) , modern science has concentrated its hopes entirely on a new acqu@@ iring concept that would offer a high level of ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical theory .
it exten@@ ds the prospects to a completely new experi@@ ment in the CER@@ N .
the standard model ( the cor@@ ner@@ stone of modern physi@@ cs used to be used in the 20th century in the 20th century ) must be spo@@ tted by the basic elements of the three partic@@ les of particula@@ te matter : electro@@ magnet@@ ism and strong and weak forces .
it allows us to provide descri@@ ptions that fit very well with what is going on in this end@@ less@@ ly small world .
however , this model does not take into account the fourth interaction - gra@@ vity .
now , qu@@ an@@ tum physi@@ cs , when the light presents itself with a partic@@ le , on the foot@@ print , using the gra@@ vity effect to be transferred to another partic@@ le , gra@@ vit@@ on .
search for harmonisation
this is why there is an obstacle ( see bo@@ x@@ ing ) on the basis of a standard model model .
moreover , at the beginning of the universe , the universe was very extreme as well as extreme mass ( all energy and matter was concentrated in a very small area ) .
consequently , the theory also descri@@ bes the partic@@ les that pre@@ dom@@ ina@@ tely domin@@ ated this period .
how do you connect all this general theory of rela@@ tivity to the E@@ inste@@ in at the beginning of the last century , which turns completely around gra@@ vity ?
&amp; quot ; M@@ uni@@ ci@@ pal@@ ity of qu@@ an@@ tum mechan@@ ics and general rela@@ tivity has become the physical Gra@@ il of physi@@ cs .
scientists are working on this problem .
the most promising way seems to be a st@@ ring theory . &amp; quot ;
points to st@@ ring
what does this theory tell us about the world ?
first , the partic@@ les will look not as bun@@ k@@ les , but if the elements can be compared with the extremely small st@@ ring , which is a 10-@@ 35 metres long ( the number 1 is p@@ rece@@ ded by 35 zer@@ os on the left ) .
these st@@ rings vi@@ brate and the nature of their vibra@@ tions match the different types of partic@@ les .
the more st@@ ring vibra@@ tes , the greater the energy amount of the corresponding part .
one theory that is necessary for this ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical integrity is super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
in order to understand what it is , a brief description of the &amp; quot ; zo@@ ology &amp; quot ; is necessary .
K@@ van@@ t@@ ke@@ had can be divided into two families : on the one hand , there are fer@@ mi@@ ons where elec@@ tr@@ ons and blocks are covered , the other side of the Bosni@@ an family , which includes the funda@@ men@@ tals of the funda@@ men@@ tals such as phot@@ ons that channel electro@@ magnetic forces and gra@@ vit@@ on ( above ) .
Super@@ sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cs problem
Super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try consists of a pre@@ mise that each part of the fer@@ mi@@ on family corresponds to a part of the family &apos;s family and vice ver@@ sa , so sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal .
the super@@ sy@@ m@@ metric part has not yet been detected , but physi@@ cist physi@@ cs are expected to have a high energy impact in col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons that they will soon create using L@@ H@@ C , the new CER@@ N partic@@ le accele@@ ra@@ tor .
in the meantime , as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers may indirectly monitor the effects of my@@ steri@@ ous partic@@ les because the total mass of g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies and g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies appears to be much higher than the lumin@@ ous mass ( stars , gases , etc . ) which have been detected in the tele@@ sc@@ op@@ es of the as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers .
they therefore pos@@ se@@ ss the presence of in@@ visible black mass , which is a reci@@ pro@@ cal matter only through this gra@@ vity , and contains very stable , so also very mild partic@@ les .
there are many key features that the simp@@ lest super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try shares .
they may therefore be un@@ familiar with the black mass components , the phenomenon for the first time examined by the Swiss as@@ tron@@ om@@ y F@@ rit@@ z Z@@ w@@ icky in 19@@ 33 .
four interactions with one single interaction
the second question , which is proble@@ matic for researchers , concerns the four fundamental funda@@ men@@ tals of nature .
why are their streng@@ ths so different from each other ?
for example , the strength of gra@@ vity reciproc@@ ity is much weak@@ er than the electro@@ magnetic interaction .
as proof of this , the magnetic field is sufficient to attract relatively large metal mass , while the entire planet is required to move the same mass .
one question that is the question is that all the fundamental interactions are only one of the most important inter@@ faces , which began to fall at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse .
business persis@@ tence is vital to the success of business .
and in the modern world , vir@@ tually every company &apos;s operation is vulnerable to disrup@@ tions .
some risks may dis@@ continue your business for days , but in a competitive environment even four hours may be fatal .
