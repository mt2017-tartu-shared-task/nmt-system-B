The purpose of this report is to describe the steps which should be built on the human resources management function – to clarify the "PH" strategy and operations.
Currently, the investment component is not a Ph-function.
The idea of this report was in the debate on 22 September of the EUPCU leader, Dace Rozega.
The Ph-plan has also been discussed, but also with other entities: Anita Bisofa, Valda Ceputers and Valdis Bisters.
Moe's investment division is growing rapidly and is now facing many changes over the coming years.
Possible changes in the department's organisation have already been weighed.
The pressure to deal effectively and correctly, both working processes and personnel issues are invaded.
In the current situation, the directors and the Heads of Unit of the Unit are so busy so that there is no time for the development of the development of a PH.
It is strongly recommended to appoint a person responsible for the use of a member of the PH in order to focus on the creation of a staff management system and is able to develop it in accordance with the practical needs.
Before the investment division of the investment department, the vision and mission of the department must be clear.
The Investment Department's strategy and the short-term action plan is recommended once a year be reviewed.
The participation of the EU, but also in the national programmes, should be stressed as appropriate.
The number of projects will increase considerably and more and more projects reach an implementation phase affecting the number of staff needed and their areas of competence.
Soon, the PRK will be ready to be ready (manual of project implementation) and the PKJ (guide for project organisation).
They should be used in this autumn.
The PRK shall take into account the requirements of each method of financing and describe the relevant sub-processes.
These guides shall be provided with practical indicators for both the workflow and the organisation.
These instructions should serve as a basis for the following steps such as the writing of working descriptions and identifying the areas of competence.
The measures necessary for the establishment of a staff management system and in the development of a future practical need are described in Annex III.
The preliminary draft programme for the establishment of a system of a system is set out in Annex IV.
The scheme would be a prerequisite for the staff manager / Coordinator to start working with full-time work on the development of a PH at the beginning of December 2003.
The Director of the Department and the Heads of Unit of the Unit should cooperate closely with staff management staff – to inform him of the needs of continuous development and to put it in its position.
They shall also be responsible for the evaluation of the development and the scoreboard; the staff management staff shall contribute to the discussions on the modernisation of chess and data files.
The managers of entities must also play an active role in developing the themes and content of the area of competence.
The self-evaluation of competences is involved in all staff.
Staff management staff shall coordinate the assessment of competences and manages the data files.
In the draft budget for the financial year 2004, both the operating costs of the "PH" development (mainly the "Ph-worker") should be covered by the cost of operating costs and the operational costs of the training.
Implementation costs consist of direct costs (e.g. courses, leaching, materials), teaching and training, from working time, training and facilitation of training and facilitation of training by the PH-employee.
Once a year, there will also be a cost effect on the cost of the working time and the PLP conversations.
Prior to the provision of any budgetary figures, an approximate assessment of the 2004 training activities must be provided.

In the light of the call for the March 2005 Council meeting, Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for the period 2005-2008 (the "programme"), with a view to promoting the growth and employment of the country.
The programme is a policy planning document showing how to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy 2005-2008 in line with the integrated guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005.
The programme is reflected in the key challenges facing Latvia to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and shall indicate the main features of the actions and activities of these problems, as well as performance indicators for achieving these objectives.
The programme is based on the planned policy planning documents approved by the Republic of Latvia.
The development of the programme contributed to the coordination of the Lisbon Strategy.
The consultation was held with the Latvian Parliament (Latvian Parliament) and the social partners.
The programme consists of the introduction, the main part (macroeconomic, microeconomic reforms, guidelines for employment policies) and annexes.
All numerical information and figures were received from the statistical office of the Republic of Latvia or Eurostat, except in the specific cases referred to in particular.
In order to successfully achieve these objectives, ministries for the development of strategic plans to ensure that the budget for 2007 should be prepared based on the principles of strategic planning, in line with the priorities set by the government, define medium-term development objectives and guidelines for the institutions' action strategy, but also all relevant ministries, with their objectives and guidelines related programmes and sub-programmes, including their funding.
In order to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area,
The Council of Ministers adopted a decision on the establishment of a European single currency on 21 July 2005 to establish a plan of measures to be taken to ensure that Latvia successfully joined the euro area.
On 31 December 2004 State debt amounted to 975 million latin, or 13,3% of GDP.
It is expected that public debt is gradually increasing over the next few years and could reach 13.6% of GDP in 2008.
In the European Union, Latvia is one of the smallest and assumptions that it is expected to fall significantly below the national debt criterion (60% of GDP), as defined in the Maastricht Treaty.
On the basis of the information given in the current situation in Latvia, there is no urgent need to develop a specific scheme to reduce public debt, but before taking any action in the area of public debt management, there is a need to carefully analyse the potential risks to ensure that the country's most favourable transaction is made.
The main measures proposed in the public debt area 2005-2008 (Guideline 2).
In order to ensure the necessary resources to finance the national budget deficit and the refinancing of sovereign debt, as far as possible at the lowest possible cost and under favourable conditions, limiting financial risks and taking into account the development of the capital market and all financial systems of the Latvian State (responsible department: Ministry of Finance):
– to develop new debt repurchase and debt exchange programmes to manage debt refinancing risks to use the opportunities offered by the capital market to attract long-term spending;
- Related reduction of the cost of public debt costs already started, will be reviewed by all existing provisions in the field of foreign lending agreements, in order to assess the possibility of refinancing of several loans in the future by refinancing with other more favourable loans or possible amendments to the provisions of the loan agreement or the existing restrictions.
The sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed positively and is characterised by a relatively small state debt, but also adequate budgetary discipline.
Latvia ’ s commitment to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as to the euro area, is one of the additional anticipation of positive trends linked to the current budgetary position.
From a long-term perspective, the sustainability of public finances is mainly affected by the ageing of the population, leading to a decline in the population and their share in the population and increasing demographic pressures.
The preliminary calculation of financial sustainability shows that the ageing of the population is affected by the population of the Latvian society and the economy and public finances, but due to the pension reform, it does not result in overarching consequences.
The low level of government debt and the pressure of increasing costs will provide a certain degree of flexibility for the government and maintain the stability of public finances.
It must be noted, however, that the ageing population makes a new way for the health system.
According to the age group's age group, it is clear that higher costs will fall to older people, whose number will increase significantly over the next 50 years.
Long-term care costs are rather small in Latvia, which is due to the limited resources of the government and local authorities, but also of the traditions and values of society.
At the same time, health care for other demographic groups must also be ensured, as the overall incidence of morbidity is high.
The government is developing an effective health system based on a long-term perspective.
There is a need for changes to the country ’ s monetary policy to adapt to a substantially different demographic situation.
As the demographic burden will increase in the long term, the increase in the quality of the living standards of all population groups will play a decisive role in increasing productivity growth based on labour productivity.
It is therefore important to ensure that Latvia ’ s main wealth is being trained in accordance with the requirements of the labour market in order to create an accessible labour market for all (see section 3).
In the general development of the economy of the Latvian State, it is also an important contribution to the forest, as it meets the requirements of the raw materials of the largest export sector in the Latvian industry, the Latvian industry.
The forest is also an important resource for rural development, as it provides livelihoods for residents in local areas, 150 000 for forest owners and the forestry sector.
Part of the end of the end and recreational or servicing of services shall be invested by the forest owner in maintaining the value of the forest or to the introduction of continuous production.
The largest forest owners (the country, local authorities and some private liberties in the forest sector, belonging to thousands of hectares) can guarantee a continuous production process throughout the long forest management cycle.
Given the composition, age, structure, past administrative practice of the species, the economic situation of the rural region, but also the knowledge of forest owners, the continuous forest production is significantly impeded to small forest owners.
In the light of the above circumstances, there is currently a lack of investment in the restoration of forest value (revenues); it is therefore necessary to promote the productivity of wood (in the timely and quality of the forest, the use of selected forest propagating material in the forest renewal, growing youth pumping of young people;), in particular in private offices.
While Latvia's waste management systems are addicted and the awareness of the need to reduce the risk of waste is increased, the amount of waste generated by waste is increased every year.
The potential for the processing and disposal of waste is insufficient, although companies receive subsidies for the collection and disposal of waste from environmental harmful goods and products from the Latvian environmental protection fund.
Water management infrastructures (water supply and waste water collection and treatment) have been insufficiently developed and obsolete, its capacity is not economically justified, the technologies used are energy costs and does not meet all environmental requirements.
This limits the development of the activity, particularly in remote areas in the country.
Access to the water economy infrastructure has a high impact on the development of utilities, public catering, health and tourism industries.
Latvia has to define the deadline for transposition of the internal market rules, but also to ensure the coordination of the transposition of directives at national level and at political level.
As of 7 September 2005, Latvia was not notified to 1.3% of the transposition of EU directives (or 0.5% of the total number of directives).
Given that 99.5% of the Directives had been transposed into Latvia ’ s standards as of 7 September 2005, it fully confirms that the Lisbon target is met - at least 98,5% of the transposition or the promised quantity of the number of directives' transposition of the Directives.
Transposition of internal market directives and the implementation of relevant legislation will be directly dependent on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition into EU legislation.
At present, there is no effective comprehensive database based on the surveillance of EU legislation, which would allow the monitoring of the transposition process of the directives within a number of time specified in the reference period, and therefore – in addition to other factors – slows down the transposition process and the creation of the EU internal market base.
Close staff of public administrations will reduce their capacity to ensure a qualitative and timely compliance of the transposition process of the EU Directives in Latvia.
The restrictions on the freedoms of the EU internal market freedoms were lost in most of the time before Latvia's accession to the EU, but there are obstacles to the current range.
Significant obstacles stem from existing operating licences and time-consuming administrative operations requiring companies to include additional money and time, and are the worst affected by small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and compliance of existing various licenses and other restrictions on existing restrictions, including professional professions (lawyers, notaries, accountants, architects, engineers and pharmacists) in order to promote competitiveness in sectors.
In order to introduce a coherent and harmonised competition policy, the standards of competition in Latvia are harmonised in 2004 in accordance with the requirements of EU competition standards.
In order to prevent competitive obstacles to competition, or to prevent any distortion of competition, the Latvian competition authority – the Competition Council – active cooperation with the European Commission and the Member States' competition authorities.
The electricity market is gradually opening.
As of 1 July 2004, a threshold of 0,0 GWh in the case of legal persons at the same time as legal persons.
Therefore, only households are unable to choose the supplier and the opening of the electricity market is guaranteed up to 75%.
Until now, no free consumer has changed the electricity supplier.
In order to encourage competition and encourage the placing on the market of alternative suppliers, the functions of transmission and distribution of electricity are legally and functionally separated from the functionalities of the generation and sale of electricity.
The conditions for the supply of electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law.

"In order to open the door, pull the handle out of the outside."
He wasn't the only son of his father, although he had the oldest, his brother William made his business in Cuckold's Pilli and his greenhouses on the side of the village, and he had three sisters, and he had three sisters, everyone in good marriage to free men.
The municipalities of the Municipality have been located in the cities of the city, but Richardi's clan of the city of the Richardi, who were thought to migrate in the times in Wales, had been living in a long way to achieve a certain position; clan to achieve a certain position; the enlightened members like a pharmacy with cousin James' owned companies, belonged to a merchant and a corporation, made the lungs to the poor houses and you were never going to have a chance to get to the mayor.
Richard's father wasn't one of them, but he had no reason to disgrace.
After short learning at primary school, he was working as an assistant to the diner, and later, as a free man who paid his fines, he tried to stay in the hallway of the ear owner.
It was also organised by a society of society, but Margaret Biggs was from the source of the Bedminster from the peasants from the head of the farm and brought it to an asset, including reading skills, even though he did not understand.
Children, the first of these girls, came to the weather with a reasonable frequency, so that some deaths and grief did not cause the grief.
If Dick learned to rule so much to pull out, the number of children left to stay with two lively son and three.
Quite a family, and it's small enough to take care of it.
Dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read as well as to write and his hopes were centred on Richard when it became clear that two years younger, William's scholar.
So, when Richard was seven years old, he was banged into Colston's Poissance school, and he got on the back of the blue coat of bristolans that his father was poor, but he's a disrespectable, expensive anglein..
And in the past five years, he was pumped into a note of literacy and a calculation.
He learned to write a nice hand, you know, to calculate, cracked himself through Caesar's Gallia Wars, Cicero calls and Ovidius Metamorfoe, helpless cupcake and slack from the school championship. the words are swollen.
Since he was a good student, even though it was a long way from the glory, and in the wrong way, a policeman of a policeman, he escaped from the charity of Mr. Colston's charity, more easily and with bigger profits than many others.
At the age of two years, it was time to leave school and find a business or manual call for a level of education.
However, he did not choose any of the members of the Municipality of relatives to be a major surprise.
His greatest apology was made of mechanics, the pieces of the pieces of things, and it was a very admirable patience for a young man.
And on my own choice, he became the master of Lord Tomas at Him who held a gun in the arms of a gun.
My father felt the silent joy of the decision, he was pleased that one of the other questions would grow as a handful of handymanship, not a merchant.
Besides, the war was a part of life and a war needed for weapons.
The man who can prepare and repair the weapons was not threatened by a threat to the battlefield.
For Richard, a seven-year apprenticeship period was a happy career and apprenticeship, although in fact, a little bit of humility.
Like the other textbooks, he worked for hire, lived in a family house, served him in the dining table, filled the stomach with food residues and slept on the floor.
Luckily, Lord Tomas was a good host and even better with the gun.
Although he was able to make beautiful duel-shaped pistols and hunting rifles, he had enough to realize that Manton, but Manton couldn't have been outside London.
This is the case of war patterns for his work, from the soldiers from the soldiers of the Fessiken Bessiah, with wooden beans, gracious cuffs, and still a peanut brown hair.
In the nineteen years, Richard got the masterpiece, and moved out of the Hell of Hell, but not his workshop.
That's where he kept working on the Pruunts Besters.
And he got married, as if the woman that's got a woman in a feast has been restored.
As a husband, he became his mother's brother's daughter, maybe a flesh cousin, but that there was no objections to the English church, he was his bride in St. James's Church of his church teacher with his cousin James.
Well, marriage was arranged, but there was a lot of love that had to be seen in the years between the husbands.
Although there was some confusion regarding the fact that Richard Morgan and Margaret Briggs, Richard Morgan, Richard Morgan took a woman named Margaret Briggs.
As long as the Habitic Arms House worked, there was nothing strange about it, because a young couple lived in a remortal rental to Avon Street Street, to the Temple, Hell of Hottle, and a Jew synagogue, and the Jew synagogue. get out of here.
Marriage was signed in 1767, three years after the end of the seven-year war with France, with the unpopular peace agreement; in spite of debt, England was forced to increase taxes, and to make money to swallow the money and the fleet sharply..
So all the guns are no longer needed, so the masters and the textbooks, one at a time, until the entire company was assembled by the whole of Richard and Lord Tomas.
And then, for a while after a little Mary was born in 1770, he was reluctant to shoot Richard's prick.
"Come to work," called Dick Morgan hard.
"Reling is coming and go, but the rum will remain."
And so became a matter of name.
Richardi's mother was always summoned in a short run of Mag and Richard's wife Peg, both of Margaret.
The greater problem was, however, that all men of England – if you exclude the male descendants of the male protests who were risen to Cranfields and Onesiphors - were either John, William, Henry, the name of Richardi, James or Thomas, and all the women were donated, Catherine'id, Margarets, Elizabeth or Marys.
It was one of the little practices that suited everyone, the king's beasts.
"This is the first time I can see."
It was called a diver of a diver who was just in the back of a research vessel to soil, and there was barely a word from excitement.
After the ladder, he took a leak and he took off the mask and took them to the prairie.
He then stretched himself out of the poor water, by losing the balance of the cylinders, but as a matter of fact, the amount of aid from above the above aid was landed alive and on the deck of the ship.
In the moment, the tiny statue was surrounded by other crew members who were already waiting for the diving deck.
Jack Howard stepped down from the captain and smiled to a friend.
He still couldn't believe that the bodywork guy can move under the water so much.
In the back of the back deck, there was a blowout on his mouth, a friend of a beloved Asian tone in the years.
"And we thought that you were swimming back to Athens and the sitting with the gin and tonic in your father's pool. '
The study does not based on solid qualitative data, forecasts or personal opinions, but are assembled from a wide range of sources, including interviews, arrogance, trends and audiences.
All data prior to the 1990 dossier are based on interviews and numerous newspapers, television and radio internet searches, more specifically in the search for information collection methods.
The schedule for the period after 1998 is based on everything that has occurred in the last 11 years and which I have read about 1000 different studies.
The schedule for 2009 and the next few years is based on the forecasts for me and others for the coming years.
The schedules do not claim to a hundred percent accurate, the aim is to provide an overview of the change of the situation and to outline the social media news, targeted communication and other future.
The objective of the article is to make people think.
We are now seeing a completely innovative way of how people can communicate - a way that makes traditional ways of simple ones.
This is a fundamental change that will change the world as we feel completely.
The best thing about this is that you can help us with this.
Come with me to a tour of the last 210-year tour of information sources, plus a glimpse of the next ten years.
Before we get to the future, let's see how we got today, let's start to get back to the 1800, where we're going to find the information.
In the 1800s, we came out and get together with them.
Everything was in touch with face-to-face.
To sell the product, you should have gone to the local market and the only possible way to communicate was to meet in a personal way or to set the sales table.
It meant to you, to get the information, to get it in the right place in time.
You didn't know what happened in other parts of town, and they couldn't sell their products to people in another place.
They were told about a novel concept called the newspaper...
In 1900, newspapers and magazines have changed communication, allowing us to get news from places where we were never.
We received our ideas for the people we've never seen, and sell their products to the others who were far away.
We were supposed to go out and talk to other people, but we got to know things about our town.
It was incredible - the first real information revolution.
The world started opening up.
Since 1920, a new source of information - the radio.
Suddenly, you could listen to another human voice from hundreds of miles away.
But the most important thing was that the latest information was possible in real time.
It was the next huge development of information in history.
However, the radio development times meant that, until 1960, in our lives, the newspapers were dominated by the newspapers.
If you wanted to have the latest news, or introduce to people your product, you would have used a newspaper for that.
It felt that they were a dominant source of information much longer.
This situation began in 1960.
The radio has reached and two main sources of information were reported in real time on the radio and more detailed news from newspapers and magazines.
It was a great time for the media, although some said that "In order to compete with the radio, better newspapers should be made" the argument that we could have heard repeatedly for the next 50 years.
During the next 40 years, the next technological revolution was introduced - television.
It began to collect public interest in the 1950s and the beginning of the 1990s, the spread of large newspapers and magazines, while still dominated by the radio.
Now you got the people to hear the information and look at it.
The years in the 1970s was also the time when the publishers realised that something was terribly wrong with their sales market.
They had a lot of trouble on the radio race, but the television was on another class.
Only eight years later, and the television in the information world, the radio almost changed only a "place where free music has been able to listen to free music ” and the newspapers did everything you could to remain appropriate.
The continuous development of the technology continued to be consistent, which was never seen before.
A new phenomenon of phenomena in the shadows: the Internet.
1998 was the year when the Internet became a strange place which had not much importance, indisputably important, with a view that each undertaking must have a website.
The revolution had started for three years earlier, but in 1998 this critical mass reached a critical mass and sought to all attention, despite the relatively low of the lack of access to it.
However, all agreed that it was the future - the beginning of a new era.
It was a place where everyone could get information everywhere, at least in theory.
People started to understand that the Internet was more than just information.
When joining the interview, you got something back, and to be part of it, instead of being a tracer.
The most important thing, however, was to choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do so.
The Internet's chances were wrestling.
In 2004, only six years later, the Internet has changed the way we were taking stock.
However, television and newspapers have been dominated by our news sources, but the newest world was definitely on the Internet.
People made new websites and discovered the world of online applications.
People were able to do so much and to participate in a number of areas, so that a new formula was seen: information overheating.
For the first time in my life, we were in contact with more information than we could have done.
In the era of the newspaper, we had to choose what we wanted to see.
In 2004, we had to choose what we did not want to see.
It had a devastating effect on the traditional image of the information.
In the past, it was possible to get people's attention in doing something.
People wanted more choice, so they just came to give them a new option.
This change in 2004 because something different wasn't enough: it was supposed to be better.
2004 was also a year when another phenomenon began to emerge: communication networks.
This concept was quietly collected by blogs through the blogs.
It was an easy, simple and accessible way to share your ideas.
For the first time, all of us had a chance to create our own information rate without technical failure.
This information was changed from professional tools to all the tools.
Three years later, and the social element of the Internet showed a powerful man's voice.
For the first time, television was no longer the main source of information and the newspapers fought for survival.
Everyone wanted to create a small world and bring it to his friends.
2007 was also a breaking point for traditional websites that people compare the information in newspapers - static and passive.
We wanted active information.
We wanted to be part of this, not just to look at it.
The blogs started getting into trouble.
As the television was removed by the radio (as it was better and the richest way for people to provide information on people), the social networks have blocked the blogs.
The social profile is a more active way for people to share what they care about.
Social networks can simply be better and blogs can't survive on it.
Two years later, today, the new Internet is dominated by our world.
The newspapers are dead in the water, and people look less on TV than ever.
We are the new kings, using the tools of social networks to contact and communicate.
Even the traditional web site dies, which has been killed by a continuous flow of information from the social networks.
In the last 210 years, we have seen an amazing development we can get.
The main steps are:
1. getting information from remote places.
2, getting it in real time.
Three of this vision in real time.
It's time to decide when to look at something and look at what you're looking at.
Option 5, to take part and comment.
6. publication of information.
7. being a source of information.
2009 is the beginning of the next revolution.
All we know is going to change.
The first and the most dramatic change is the concept of social news.
This will quickly take over our need to be familiar with what is happening in the world.
There will be no further news from journalists, because now it comes from everything.
They will be transmitted directly from the source, leaving the traditional media channels.
Instead of sending a journalist to transmit what analysts say, you can hear it from your analyst.
The social news will get news from the source and uncentred.
The new entertainment wave (blue and glazing areas) is developing, dominated by games, video and sound streams.
Instead of putting on a TV channel, you decide what you want to see and when you wish to look at it.
We don't join the canals, where someone else decides what we can look at.
You control all the experience.
In the form of information, a new concept will be highlighted.
We are already seeing the growing number of mobile telephony services that provide local information about the region in which they are located.
For example, instead of showing all the restaurants in the world, the phone only shows the list in your area.
It's something that's going to grow off in the next few years.
In the world where we have access to more information, if we can consume, it is a very important element to obtain relevant information, as far as much further in the simple location of the simple location we see today.
The information world will change over the next five or ten years.
All traditional forms are eventually dying.
Printed newspapers do no longer exist, television in the form of current channels is replaced by individual programmes that can be seen if you want.
Radio yields are designed to be replaced by flash-holders and video broadcasts.
Internet websites have a much lower role - their primary function is to be a distributor of activities that can be done elsewhere, as a place where people can be used in other places of raw materials.
Many websites and communication networks join in one.
The social news, as described in advance, can become the best way of dealing with people.
The traditional journalism is completely transformed because people get information directly from the source.
Each one is a potential reporter, but the new advantages for the use of target groups will take part in the majority of the poison.
Journalists are becoming editorial who instead of sending the news, they bring them in, giving us a bigger picture.
The future of the future of the future is personalised, and it is constantly changing according to what you are looking at, in the same way as Last.fm is doing music today.
All in the form of a target group.
You have control of every single inflate that moves in your direction.
In 2010, two new concepts are beginning to rise.
One of them is intelligent information where information flows can be included in several different news sources, not just pulling the data, but taking it together, sharing it into the sections and issuing valuable parts.
Instead of a number of five different articles, instead of reading the same route, you will be given one, to highlight the important points of interest.
How safe are your Christmas lights?
EU tests show serious risks for the electric shock and fire resistance of the lamps.
Stay safe, turn them off when you go to bed or get out of the house.
The market survey carried out by the Commission has been issued in order to ensure that there was a direct risk of fire safety or electric shock at each third test set.
The tests were carried out in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Slovenia and Slovakia of nearly 200 sheer sets of total price categories.
Samples were checked over 20 claims and many fell in more than one test.
The Commission found a number of shepherds and poor insulation and poor insulation.
Only over 40% of the samples were made in China.
In Hungary, almost 96% of sheep were found to be dangerous.
In the Netherlands, 56% did not respond to EU market standards.

Consumer protection Commissioner Maglena Kuneva said that the results were to be awakened.
He urged EU Member States to do better work on security requirements and said that industry (producers, retailers, resale and importers) should also have to improve the effectiveness of controls.

It is expected that, in Stockholm, some 4 000 participants will take part of 1 500 organisations in which EU attempts to make the development more efficient.
The general topic "citizens and development" will focus on the effects of global warming and the economic downturn in the poorest countries.
Even though they are usually the last person to blame, especially those countries have an economic decline and climate change.
The rise in sea levels, desertification and increased and more serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and to undo the development objectives achieved over the millennium.
And the current economic climate has led to a reduction in helping developing countries, reducing food guarantees in the already vulnerable areas.
Bringing together politicians, state officials, NGOs, business leaders, academics, researchers and media, European Development Days offer the opportunity to create relations, sharing experiences and to find new partners for development projects.
Three days of a lasting event starting on 22 October, includes training, discussion forums and workshops.
"The development village" offers organisations the opportunity to publicise themselves to delegates and to the public and to raise awareness of their objectives.
A number of developments related to development are shared, including the Lorenzo Natali Prize for Journalism, for the excellent presentation of human rights, democracy and development.
The development of young people is going towards teenagers or videos, showing human development in Africa.
On October, the EU will also make public the first European Development Report.
This constitutes a source of departure for the EU's approach to the "fragile" of fragile African countries.
The EU provides more than half of all development aid.
The donors' conference sends strong signals to support Georgia.
Until later, Georgia had the most rapidly developing economy of the world - 12% increase in 2007.
In August, this change in the short, but in an intense conflict in August.
The key modes of transport and utilities were damaged, buildings and houses became a rock and the bombs were destroyed and the bombs destroyed large forest areas.
More than two months later, many foreign investors have left, the tourists have gone, unemployment has risen and many georgians have emptied their bank accounts.
The World Bank is now forecast that Georgia, the energy mix to Europe, needs to recover EUR 2.4 billion.
Over the next three years, the EU has allocated EUR 500 million and the US has committed EUR 757 million (1 billion), over half of this year by the end of this year.
The EU and the World Bank were hosted by the donors' conference on 22 October, to meet the remaining EUR 1.1 billion.
Nearly 70 countries and the institution were invited to the event.
The aid will support reconstruction and help the Georgia Government to meet the first needs of these people who had to escape their homes.
Tens of thousands of people reset, many of them find shelter in temporary refugee centres.
However, the long-term objective is to restore the Georgia economy, which has undergone major changes in recent years.
"It is important that the crisis does not lead Georgia away from doing political and economic reforms, which are now more important than before the conflict of conflict, Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Commissioner for External Relations.
The former Soviet Republic will normally receive around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union.
Between Georgia and Russia, the differences between South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been divided by the Georgian province, which Russia recognises as independent states.

Now, in its sixth year, the international success of the prize and the support of the European music industry, which provides jobs for approximately 600 000 people.
Among former winners, artists are now known as Carla Bruni, Tokio Hotel, Damien Rice, The Fratellis and Gabriel Rios, the singer born in Puerto Ricos, who lives in Belgium.
He is present at the ceremony of this year, which is recorded and real-time over the EBU network via the network of TV- and radio stations on Saturday, 17 January, beginning at 20: 15 (CET).
One of the last winners of the last year was the Finnish rock band, Sunrise Avenue, which was victory for the album to Wonderland.
Mikko Saukkonen, the campaign campaign of the band Bonnier Amigo said that the prize is a group that is currently recording the second album.
"We are very confident that this will help the band in the future."
The 2008 Cannes Festival shows the success of EU funded films in the world.
Fourteen films that have been partially supported by the EU media programme have been chosen in 61 Cannes International Film Festival.
For film festivals, EU funding has no longer an alien and over the years have seen millions of people.
The EU Media Programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of the continent through the film.
However, European film makers are confronted with major challenges both internationally and at home.
During the 19th May, the sixth ‘ European Day of the European Day ’, the EU ’ s representatives, together with European film ministers and producers, will sit down to discuss how to stimulate the audiovisual industry for greater international cooperation.
The aim is to extend the content of the content to other parts of the world and to cooperate more closely with other film industries outside the EU.
Such an international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films.
Last year's Cannes Festival, a single film funded by the EU media programme.
And at the beginning of this year a number of EU backgrounds were presented (e.g. The ballot iters and La Môme) Oscars.
14 EU funded films in the Cannes 2008 festival: Gomorère, Delta, La frontière de l'aube, Le silence de Lorna, The Palermo Shooting, sangue pazzo, Entre les broken Tulpan, Eldorado, Elève butts, Salamandra, Les Pueu de Dieu, Better things and Home.
The EU and China Summit in Prague on 20 May, was the subject of climate change, the financial crisis and economic relations.
The EU and China signed agreements to extend cooperation with regard to science and technology, clean energy and small business.
They reaffirmed their commitment to the project in order to develop technology, how to produce electricity from coal unallocated - one of the main gas that is the cause of global warming.
Two sides discussed the views on the international climate change debate in Copenhagen in December.
The EU recommends developing emerging economies, such as China, to limit CO2 emissions by offering financial support from developed countries.
With regard to the financial crisis, the EU and China agreed that the international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic risks and should have more say in these institutions in these institutions.
At the top of the summit in May, two trade and investment were highlighted by the two parties as a key to economic recovery.
Two sides also discussed the human rights situation in Tibet and conflict in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Pakistan - three countries in which China has a significant influence.
On Tuesday 15 December, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Estonia on behalf of the Prime Minister of Estonia, with the sympathy to the people and Prime Minister of Estonia in Afghanistan's soldiers in Afghanistan.
In my condolences, the Prime Minister stressed that the death of a soldier is a huge loss for the victim's family and all of Estonia.
Today, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis and the Minister for Agriculture, Jānis DŪKLAVS, President of the Estonian Minister for Agriculture, Valdor Seederi, Minister of Agriculture, Lithuanian Agriculture and Agriculture and Food, Belarus Shaperoga to discuss the trend of the future of agricultural cooperation.
The Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture, Jānis DŪKLAVS, announced four countries that were signed today and which will create better conditions for their cooperation in agriculture.
It is based on equality and mutual benefit by harmonising legislation and exchanging information and by exchanging practical projects.
The Prime Minister stressed: "A" that was signed today, to promote cooperation on the economy of all four countries in a very important area - agriculture.
The Belarusian Agriculture and Food Secretary, Semyon Shapiro, thanked the Latvian Minister for Agriculture, Jānis, on the initiative of the Dūklavsi, on his visit to Minsk, to bring together the three Baltic States and Belarus ministers, not just to discuss problems and the current events in this area, but also put in place specific tasks to be carried out in the future.
The Belarusian Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Minister pointed out that Belarus has extensive practical experience in the production of agricultural machinery and that the country would be interested in the creation of joint ventures with Latvia.
Minister Shapiro called for the help of Latvia and other countries of the Baltic States to provide practical experience in the certification of businesses producing agricultural products and farmers producing agricultural products, in order to ensure the selling potential of agricultural products in Belarus on the EU market.
The Lithuanian Agriculture Minister Kazys STARKEVIČIUS in Brussels, expressed its gratitude for active mutual cooperation between the three Baltic States, Finland and Poland in the European Union, but today a new cooperation model between the three Baltic countries and Belarus was launched.
The Austrian Minister for Agriculture, Mr Valdor, stressed that Latvia is currently active in the field of agriculture in the field of agriculture which is likely to grow.
The Minister also announced that Estonia's budget for the next year has three main priorities, one of them is agriculture.
On Wednesday, 9 December in Bonn, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis became the European National Party for the Private Private Award for Private Private Business Policy.
The prize was awarded by Mr Peter Jungen by Mr Peter Jungen, who pointed out that the main aim of the prize is to shape EU policy more in a more friendly way.
The Prime Minister of Latvia thanked the EIB for the recognition of the Union and for the development of an investment friendly and efficient business environment in Europe.
V. Dombrovskis stressed that the SME Union network has contributed to the idea of introducing support measures in Latvia.
The Latvian Government has taken steps not only to ensure fiscal sustainability, but has also developed a support programme for the Latvian micro-economy, aimed at reducing barriers to micro-economic activities and to encourage unemployed people to start with their own business.
In order to achieve this objective, the government has adopted a decision to reduce the cost of free capital and registration costs, simplified tax information and accounting procedures, and ensured financial support for micro-economic activities.
In my speech, the Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are becoming a driving force in the economy by contributing to a reduction in unemployment, long-term development and stability.
We have already known that the 6-10 December will be attended by Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis in the Congress of the European People's Party in Bonn, Germany.
The Steering Group has agreed with joint exchange of information that is signed on Monday, 2 November. the exchange of information will be evaluated by the current group, and highlights the main tasks that need to be achieved in the context of the structural reforms.
The exchange of information shall correspond to the model of cooperation, established by the Government and non-governmental bodies representing a joint responsibility for the socio-economic situation in the country, the international obligations of Latvia and their impact on future developments.
The Steering Group has set priorities for these tasks, which directly focus on the competitiveness, growth and recovery of the national economy.
The Group stresses that the impact assessment of the combined basic functions carried out and the rational use of potential public budgets has taken progress, to define the reduction in funding, according to the results of the tasks and functions of the tasks aimed at closing the linear financing.
Although the agreement was reached - a small and effective administration of the administration, the extension of the internal and external market for Latvia for the Latvian economy and the promotion of employment - members of the group shared the overall view of the need to continue to establish a clearer framework for structural reforms in the future.
The Reformine Management Group believes that it is necessary to continue the active introduction of social security measures, measures included in the recovery plan aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and attracting investment, measures to support micro-economic activities and start-up, deep public administration. analysis of functions, accelerating the evaluation methodology, and "stop and locate" principle in the organisation of the service.
The Reformine Management Group has agreed to the need to streamline the introduction of EU programmes, which in the current period has been delayed and reached a two-year period of two years, and it is also considering that the average budget should be implemented by dividing the budget for operational and financial budgets, linking the external market to recover future development priorities, creating an attractive investment climate for internal and external capital by reducing taxes and introducing other comparable incentives.
The Reformine Management Group was set up in July 2009 with a view to ensuring public participation in the reduction of the budget and making decisions.
26-l and 27 November, the Rio International Conference held a "unregistered partnership in the European Union".
Latvia and Estonia agree jointly to renounce the territory of a diplomatic mission in the Arab Republic of Egypt.
With effect from 1 January 2010, the offices of Latvia and Estonia, together with the rented complex in the Egyptian Arab Republic, will be optimised by optimising their administrative costs.
This agreement was reached between the Minister of Foreign Affairs Maris Riekeks and the Estonian Foreign Minister, Urmas Paeti, during his formal visit on 18 February, in this year, and ended with the following talks between foreign ministers.
This initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Baltic States in the Baltic States of the Baltic Ministers of the Baltic States, which Latvia will take in 2010 that similar projects will be introduced in the future.
The Latvian Embassy in Cairo has been active since 2007, which was officially opened in March 2009 in Maris Riekstink's visit to Egypt in March 2009.
As from 2010, Estonia will start the work in Egypt on premises rented with Latvia.
Latvia is represented by Maris Selga since the Arab Republic of Egypt.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Maris Riekstinite, with the Foreign Minister of the Foreign Affairs of the Russian Foreign Minister, called for a rapid solution to the situation of freight carriers at the Russian border.
On December, a telephone conversation was held between the Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation on Sergey Lavrov and both parties discussed the results of the relations between countries in 2009, as well as the current developments in the situation of freight carriers at the border of Latvia.
Both foreign ministers share the view that the situation of mutual relations in this year may generally be assessed positively.
Next, the ministers reviewed the agenda for the upcoming EU-Russia relationship, including further improvements in the legal framework, such as a number of important agreements between several governments.
Ministers RIECSTINS and Lavrov also discussed the current situation on freight carriers at the borders of Latvia and Russia.
As a result of the increased customs controls in the Russian Federation, the situation in Latvia, the Russian border and the length of the border in Latvia, is needed to release a rapid solution, because this leads to significant losses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out in the telephone interview..
Ministers agreed that the institutions of the two countries, including the Latvian Maanterer, Latvia, should continue to make efforts to normalise the situation in the near future, in accordance with the agreement reached on 18 December of the Intergovernmental Commission Working Group on Transport.

My name is Susan Harris, and I'm writing to Lockwood High School.
We would like to invite you to participate in a special event that is going on in our school.
Your fire would be honored.
Please respond no later than Monday, 26 February, to confirm your presence.
We hope to see you here,
Sincerely, Susan Harris.
In 2007, the most powerful particle accelerator, CERN new Large Hadron Collider, measuring the secret secrets of the energy that were only moments after the Big Paul.
In descending time, when they move to the light of light on the light of light, scientists expect to find information about the previous forms using the energy absorbed by impact.
What is expected of the great investment that Europe has done to produce LHC?
It sends two proton speeds, particles formed from an atomic tux, which belongs to a particle family, in different directions through the circle of the underground tunnels of 27 km, located under Switzerland and France.
To speed up the proton, and to ensure that they are closed into a narrow speed rain, strong magnetic fields are needed; these fields are generated by the ultimate leaders, the materials capable of leading the electricity to an obstacle or an energy loss and which are very low. temperatures, and which have been produced in cooperation with the European industry.
At the speed of the proton, at the speed of eight hundred hundred million million in a second, an enormous amount of energy was 14 TEV.
In order to understand the size of this magnitude, 1 TEV is about the amount of energy that is using a flying mosquito to move.
But in the LHC, this energy is concentrated one million to a smaller area when it's a bug.
As energy can be transferred to the shares according to a limited relativity principle (the famous E = mc2), physicians expect to create particles that have never been observed in the accelerators.
The frequency and intensity of collision is important because they make the possibility of particles to see the appearance of particulate matter.
There will also be two main nuclear accelerators with energy clams of 1 150 TeV, but with fewer collision numbers per second.
Search for supersymmetrical...
Certain sensors are capable of analysing collision.
The two names are the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and Atlas (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus).
They focus on detecting supersymmetrical particles and High bosses.
What's super symmetry?
There are several symmetrics, such as maiden and antimatter.
Supersymmetry is linked to the fermion (construction material for mailing, such as electronic and quarts) with every boss (directing the transfer, such as photon) and vice versa.
The challenge is that the supersymmetry induced by the antiparticle supersymmetrical (also specified of the S-particles) has never been observed.
How do you find them?
Paradoxically, through their absence.
"This is a little bit like being a movie.
You're counting on the number of people entering and leaving people.
If a person is missing at the end, because of the fact that you know who came in, you'll know who didn't.
In the same way, the LHC tests are known to result in certain antiques that are invisible to all sensors.
Knowing before the collision particulate matter, they compare particulate matter for particulate matter after impact.
If there are differences in energy, the part has escaped.
By calculating the missing energy, they shall know whether a supersymmetry component or an antipart is involved.
The second challenge for cms and LHS is the discovery of the Higher bosses.
The standard model theory for the focus point is expected to be mutual and to give them the mass.
How?
Let's say it's a dozen physics students.
Suddenly, Albert Einstein, the students will gather around him and start bombing him with questions.
If Albert tries to move, he knows a certain inert inert on her side students.
He's similar to those parts than the Higher bosoms are trying to exert their interactions with them. they're collecting mass.
Here, too, the discovery of their famous bosses can only be indirect: the particles that arise as a result of their degradation, are the ones being discovered.
Kvargi-gluon soup
The third sensor, with which LHC is equipped, is called Alice (a major ion acceleration experiment).
This objective is to detect unidentified parts of nuclear physics, especially the matter of the matter, which were present in a very short period of time after the Great Paul, and known as the name of a quarter gullion.
What is the new character?
In the 1960s, scientists knew the protons and neutralized that formed the core of the atom, they were made even more from the original parts of the quarters.
These blocks are with strong forces (which are directed by glues called glues) to each other.
For one of them, it is that they are diverse together: they are always either in pairs or in tricks; they cannot exist alone.
The more you try to separate Kvark from the second quarter, the greater the more coherent with them that keeps them, making them permanently separate.
The quarks say they're in jail.
However, if the proisons are bombed against each other in a large energy, a block containing a quarrel and glucans will be created in which blocks can move freely.
Then we can make reference to the release of the quarks in the quarter-gluten soup.
What is the release for?
"This is a bit comparable to skiing.
If there's not much snow, the rains can be separated from grasslands and skies are limited to their facility.
On the other hand, if there's a lot of snow, they can change the trail.
They are free from restrictions. "
Instead of snow, physics add energy: the greater the supply of the quarterly energy, the weaker is a cohesive force, so the generosity can be allocated at a higher level of energy.
The plasma of Kvargi-gluone was likely to be a matter of order for a few microseconds after the Big Paul.
This is the reason why physicians want to explore it by using the ion speeds created by the LHC.
In essence, they are very rich in terms of proton and neutrons.
They may be able to achieve an energy 1 150 TEV, which is necessary for the plasma glutebone plasma which was unprecedented to the beginning, the creation and investigation of the Universum.
Mystery puzzle
Finally, the last sensor called LHCb, the Great Hadron accelerator.
It is the duty to better monitor the weirdest differences between the matter and the antimails, so that we can better understand what happened to the antidote of the universe.
For each particle, there is an antidote which has the same mass among the other characteristics.
Therefore, there is a negative mass for the on-board electronic means, but an antielectric (or positron) corresponding to a positive loan.
If the electricity and the antigen get together, they will destroy each other, the result is the power to energy.
According to the standard physics standard model, a quantity of maize and antimatter was established at the beginning of the universe.
So all the particles should destroy each other and the universe should be empty.
However, as anyone can see, the matter is very hard.
This is a place where the question of which LHCb is trying to respond to: where is the antimatter?
One possible answers are based on a certain particle capacity to change their own anticipation and vice versa.
In this case, the presence of a matter of the matter (which is expected to be proved) that the conversion of an antiparticle transformation is dependent on the opposite transformation of the universe at the beginning of the universe.
Can you demonstrate such imbalances?
It's actually been experimental in the quarter-type particles that are called oars.
Anticaons are converted into spontaneously, but the opposite is much more farther.
The LHCb shall examine the second candidate, the B-mesonit, containing (including other things) the element (or its antiosa), which is called for a block B or a decorator (which is also known as LCHb).
Although the particles cannot be seen, it is possible to detect them.
To this end, LHC is equipped with devices containing several contrictions (such as onion) that are surrounded by a particle speed where the impact is carried out.
Each layer specializes for a specific type of discovery.
There's a vault in the middle of the sensor, there are millions of leaders in this chamber that produce electrical impulses, if there's a part of it.
These impulses are recorded by computers, which makes it possible to reconstruct their trajectories.
There's a magnetic field in every sensor.
It will help to detect and investigate the particle particle (e.g. electric or proton) trajectory which is sensitive to the magnetic field.
Second, the installation is the builder of the calorimeter.
Some calorians will stop these particles, such as fools or electors, but others have been designed to stop neutrons and fools.
They swore them to the particle energy loss.
Aid from the strings
How to define the essence of the algovels separated from the mechanisms leading to their creation?
In addition to the model physics standard model (resulting in quantum mechanical postulates), today's science has concentrated its hopes fully on the new concept that the high-level mathematical scene was offered.
It's the prospect of a whole new type of experiments on the CERN.
The standard model (modern physics cornerstone, taken from the poor, over the 20th century), must provide the elements of the elementary elements of three main interfaces between particle particles: electromagnetism and strong and weak forces.
It lets us offer the descriptions that fit very well with what is going on in this infinite little world.
However, this model does not take into account the fourth intercourse - gravity.
Now, quantum physics, when the light presents itself a particle, the footprint is to be transferred to another particle, graviton, graviton.
Search for harmonisation
When describing this part of the standard model, this is therefore an obstacle (see boxks).
Furthermore, at the beginning of the Universe, the Universe was so extreme and extreme mass (all the energy and the matter of the matter of energy were concentrated in a very small square of the square).
Consequently, the theory also describes the parts that predominately dominated during this period, the gravity cannot be excluded from gravity.
How do you combine the general relatification theory (issued by Einstein at the beginning of the last century), which is fully reversible on the gravity of the gravity?
‘ quantum mechanics ’ harmonisation and overall relativity theory has become the true Holy Grail of physics.
The people of scientists are working on this problem.
The most promising path seems to be a string theory. "
From points to string.
What does this theory tell us about the world?
First of all, this particles will look at the points, but the elements that can be compared with extremely small strings, which is 10 to 35 metres long (number 1 preceding 1 preceding zero, the first of them is to the left side).
These strings are vibrating and the nature of their vibration corresponds to the different types of particles.
The more the string vibrates, the greater the amount of energy in question.
One string theory for this mathematical integrity is supersymmetry.
In order to understand what this is, a brief description of the elementary particulate matter is a useful description of the ‘ zoology ’.
The bodies in the universe can be divided into two families: on the one hand, there are fermions, which includes electronic and quarts, on the other side of the bosoms of the bosoms of the fundamentals, such as fools electromagnets, and graviton (above the above) for gravity.
The issue of supersymmetry
Supersymmetry shall consist of the assumption that any part of each Fermion family corresponds to a part which belongs to the boss's family and vice versa, thus symmetry.
The supersymmetrical part has not yet been discovered, but partial physicians rely on them with a high energy impact, which they will have to create by using LHC, a new particle accelerator to the new CERN.
In the meantime, astronomers may indirectly monitor the effects of their mysterious particles, since the total mass of galactic and galactic aggregates appears to be much greater than the retro-reflective mass (letters, gases, etc.), which have been detected in astronomers ’ telescopes..
They therefore post the presence of the invisible black mass, which is a matter of interaction with other matter only through its gravity, and contains very stable, hence very light particles.
There are a number of basic features that are the easiest supersymmetry particles sharing.
These can therefore be the ingredients of the black mass, the phenomenon of the first time in the Swiss astronomy Fritz Zwicky in 1933.
Four interactions from one single counterparty
The second question which is problematic for researchers concerns the fundamental interaction of nature of nature in nature.
Why is their strength so different from each other?
For example, the strength of gravity is much weaker than the electromagnetic interactions.
It is proof that a magnetic field from a single magnetic field is sufficient to attract a relatively large metal mass, while the entire planet is needed to move the same mass.
One question to this question is that all the main interactions are only one of the extremely high energy rates, which began to fall at the beginning of the Universe.
