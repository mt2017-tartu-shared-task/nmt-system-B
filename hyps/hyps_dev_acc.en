the aim of this report is to describe the steps to be taken to build a function of person@@ ali@@ zation fun@@ ction@@ ality – to clarify the P@@ H strategy and operations .
there is currently no investment department P@@ H@@ -@@ fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the idea of this report was the EU@@ P@@ C@@ U leader in the debate on 22 September .
however , the content of the P@@ H@@ -@@ plate was also discussed with other entities : An@@ ita B@@ is@@ of@@ a , Val@@ da Ce@@ pu@@ ters and Val@@ dis B@@ is@@ ters .
the Mo@@ e Investment Department is growing rapidly and stands at the moment of many changes with many changes .
possible changes in the department &apos;s organisation are already at stake .
the pressure to address effective and re@@ tic@@ ul@@ arly work processes and person@@ al@@ hu@@ ms is in@@ va@@ ding .
in the current situation , directors and units of units have been attra@@ cted to the projects , so that there is no time to develop P@@ H .
it is recommended that the person responsible for P@@ H be appointed , who can focus on the establishment of the person@@ ali@@ zation system and would be able to further develop it in accordance with practical needs .
prior to the investment department P@@ H planning , the mission and mission of the department must be clear .
the strategy of the Inves@@ ti@@ gation Division and the short term action plan is recommended once a year .
E@@ li , but also in national programmes should be stressed in accordance with actual needs .
the number of projects is expected to increase significantly and progressi@@ vely increasing the implementation of the implementation phase , which affects the number of workers required and their field of competence .
the key is the PR@@ K ( the Hand@@ book of implementation of the project ) and P@@ K@@ J ( project management instructions ) .
they should be used in this au@@ tumn .
the PR@@ K shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the relevant processes .
these instructions provide practical guidance on both the flow of work and the organisation .
these instructions should serve as a basis for the following pillars such as writing and identifying areas of competence .
the measures necessary for the development and further practical use of the personnel management system shall be described in Annex III .
the initial plan for setting up the P@@ H@@ -@@ system is set out in Annex IV .
the plan would be a presu@@ mption that the person@@ ali@@ zer / coordin@@ ator can start working with P@@ H in the beginning of December 2003 .
the Director of the Department and the Head of Unit should cooperate closely with the staff member , to inform him of the need for continuous development and priorit@@ ise it .
they are also responsible for the development and performance of the development of the debate ; staff management will contribute to the discussion of Mal@@ te@@ se modernisation and storage files .
the leaders of the units must play an active role in developing the themes and content of the fields of competence .
all personnel are involved in the self-@@ evaluation of the f@@ uses .
staff management shall coordinate the assessment of compe@@ ten@@ cies and manage data files .
the 2004 budget draft budget must be covered by both P@@ H development costs ( mainly P@@ H@@ -@@ worker , units , IT@@ -@@ employee pay costs ) and the cost of training .
implementation costs include direct costs ( e.g. courses , le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs , materials ) , teaching and training , training , training and training of train@@ ers , and training and facilitation of training by P@@ H@@ -@@ worker .
once a year , the cost of the lost working time is also due to the assessment and P@@ L@@ P-@@ interview .
an approxima@@ te assessment of the 2004 training activities must be provided before the provision of any budget figures .

with a view to meeting the Su@@ pre@@ me Council meeting of March 2005 , Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for the years 2008 ( the &amp; quot ; programme &amp; quot ; ) , with a view to promoting the growth and growth of the country .
the programme is a policy planning document , which shows how Latvia will achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the years to 2008 , by the Council endorsed by the Council in July 2005 .
the programme will be war@@ ran@@ ted to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , the most important challenges for Latvia and the main features of actions and actions to tackle these problems , but also the performance indicators for achieving these objectives .
the programme is based on the draft policy planning documents approved by Latvia .
the development of the programme was assisted by the Lisbon Council .
they were consulted on the Se@@ im ( Latvia Parliament ) and the social partners .
the programme includes the introduction of the main part ( mac@@ ro economic policy , micro@@ economic reforms , guidelines for employment policy ) and annexes .
all numer@@ ical information and ar@@ sen@@ ic data from the statistical official of Latvia , or Euro@@ sta@@ t , except in specific cases .
in order to achieve these objectives , the minis@@ terial priorities will be the development of strategic plans , in order to prepare for the strategic planning key elements of the 2007 budget , in line with the priorities set by the government in terms of medium-term development objectives and orien@@ tations and programmes , including their funding , and , inter alia , their financing .
to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro ,
took the ministers &apos; cover on 21 July 2005 to decide to establish a European single currency in Latvia with the task of the Commission to develop a plan for the necessary measures to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro .
on 31 December 2004 , public debt amoun@@ ted to 9@@ 75 million la@@ tin@@ c or 13@@ ,@@ 3 % of GDP .
it is expected that public debt will increase further in the next years and may reach 13.@@ 6 % of GDP in 2008 .
Latvia &apos;s sovereign debt is one of the smal@@ lest , and is expected to remain below the average of the country &apos;s gross national debt in the medium term ( 60 % of GDP ) as defined in the M@@ aas@@ tri@@ cht contract .
on the basis of the information provided , Latvia does not have a pressing need to develop a specific plan to reduce public debt , but before taking any action in the area of management of the public debt , possible risk must be analysed in order to ensure the most favourable national performance .
the main planned actions in the area of public debt for the year 2008 ( Guideline 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary resources to finance the public budget deficit and to re@@ finance public debt as minimum costs and conditions as favourable as possible , limiting financial risk and taking into account the development of the State capital market and all financial systems ( responsible authority :
– to develop new debt re@@ financing and debt exchange programmes for the management of debt ris@@ es in order to capita@@ lise on the opportunities offered by the capital market without lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term resources ;
the reduction of the costs incurred by the national foreign debt in the T@@ wel@@ ve States will be reviewed by all existing provisions of the external loan agreements in order to assess the future repayment of several loans in the future , re@@ financing these loans with other favourable loans or possible restrictions on the possibility and existing restrictions .
the sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed posi@@ tively and is characterised by a low level of public debt , but also a sufficient budgetary dis@@ course .
Latvia &apos;s dedi@@ cation to the Stability and Growth Pact requirements , but also in fulfilling the objective of joining the euro area , is another positive guarantee for the current fiscal position .
in a long-term perspective , the sustainability of public finances is mainly influen@@ ced by the ageing of the population , which causes the working age population and their role in the population and the increase in demo@@ gra@@ phic burdens .
the initial calculations of financial sustainability show that the ageing of the population influ@@ ences Latvia &apos;s society and the country &apos;s domestic and public finances , but it will not result in an in@@ sur@@ moun@@ table effect on the pension reform .
Latvia ’ s small debt and rising pressure sur@@ p@@ luses will provide the government with a sound flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances .
it should be noted , however , that the ageing population will test the health system in a new way .
the distribution of health costs according to age groups clearly shows that higher costs will fall to older people , whose number is notic@@ e@@ ably rising over the next 50 years .
long-term maintenance costs are currently relatively small in Latvia , which is justified by the limited use of the national government and local governments , but also from society &apos;s traditions and values .
at the same time , the health ho@@ sts of other demo@@ gra@@ phic groups must also be ensured , as the overall level of hospi@@ tality is high .
the government will develop an effective health system based on long-term prospects .
changes in the country &apos;s monetary policy are needed to adapt significantly to the current diversity of democra@@ tisation situations .
in the long term , the increase in GDP growth based on improved labour productivity growth plays a crucial role in improving the lif@@ es@@ ty@@ le of all population groups .
it is therefore important to ensure that Latvia &apos;s main wealth – training of people in line with labour market demands – to create a labour market for all ( see section 3 ) .
a major contribution to the overall development of the national economy is also a major contribution to the forest , as it meets the requirements of the raw material of the wood processing , the largest export sector in Latvia .
the forest is also an important resource for rural development , since it provides a live@@ lihood for local people working in different areas , 150 000 forest owners and the forest owners .
the income generated by the final and harmon@@ i@@ ous ra@@ dar or services shall be invested by the forest owner in the conservation or continuous production of the forest .
the largest forest owners ( the country , local governments and some priva@@ te-@@ sector companies to whom thousands of he@@ x@@ ac@@ ks are ow@@ ed to forests ) can ensure continuous production processes throughout the long term .
taking into account the composition of tree species , age , structure , previous administrative practice , the economic situation of rural areas , but also forest owners &apos; awareness of forest owners is a deter@@ rent for small forest owners .
due to the circumstances of the general nature of the case , there is currently an insufficient amount of investment in the value of the value of forests ( farms ) ; therefore , it is necessary to promote pu@@ ri@@ fied productivity ( the use of forests in the forest , the cultivation of selected forests ) , the use of the wood in the forest .
although Latvia &apos;s waste management systems have been complemen@@ ted and the awareness of society about the need to reduce the spread of pr@@ un@@ es has increased , the fla@@ g@@ ship of the pr@@ one to each year is growing .
the options for the treatment and u@@ tility process are insufficient , although companies can obtain the environmental damage generated by the environmental protection fund from Latvia from the environmental protection fund and the production and u@@ tility of waste .
water infrastructure infrastructures ( water supply and collection and installation of water ) are insuffici@@ ently developed and ob@@ s@@ olete , its capacity is not economically justified , the technology used is energy intensive and not all environmental requirements .
it restric@@ ts the development of the activity , the pre@@ ro@@ ga@@ tive of the country in remote regions .
access to water management infrastructure is influen@@ ced by the development of public u@@ tility services , social security , health and tourism .
Latvia has to determine the deadline for transposition of internal market rules , but also to ensure supervision of the national management and political level of supervision of the Directives .
in the case of 7 September 2005 , Latvia had not notified 1,@@ 3 % of the transposition of the EU Directives ( or 0.@@ 5 % of the total number of directives ) .
given that 9@@ 9@@ ,@@ 5 % of the Directives had been trans@@ posed in Latvia ’ s nor@@ mal@@ isation of 7 September 2005 , it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective is to be achieved , at least 9@@ 8.@@ 5 % of the transposition , or a deficit of 1,@@ 5 % of the transposition deficit .
the transposition and implementation of the Internal Market Directives will depend directly on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation .
there is no effective EU-wide monitoring of the transposition of EU legislation , which would provide an opportunity to monitor over the time frame set out in the directive ’ s transposition process , and thus , in addition to other circumstances , delays the transposition process and the creation of the EU internal market .
the public administration of public administrations will reduce their ability to ensure that the EU Directives are adopted and correctly repli@@ ed to in Latvia .
restrictions on the freedoms of the internal market in E@@ li had been lost in most of the EU before Latvia joined the EU , but there are still obstacles to the transposition .
significant obstacles arise from existing operational requirements and time-@@ consum@@ ing administrative operations requiring companies to receive additional money and time and the worst of small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and validity of existing different licensing and other restrictions on the EU requirements , including free professions ( soli@@ c@@ itors , no@@ taries , accoun@@ tants , ar@@ ch@@ es@@ tics , engine@@ ers and farm animals ) in order to promote competition in these sectors .
in order to stream@@ line the uni@@ fied and harmonised competition policy , there was a harmonisation of competition nor@@ ms in 2004 , according to the requirements of EU competition trends .
in order to overcome obstacles to competition across borders , or to prevent potential distortions of competition , the Competition Authority ( NC@@ A ) - the Competition Council - active cooperation with the Commission and the competition with national competition authorities is launched .
the E@@ lek@@ tri@@ an market is a lake .
in the case of 1 July 2004 , the status of the free customers of the free customer of 0,@@ 0 G@@ W@@ h was designated as legal persons .
therefore , only resid@@ ential buildings cannot be selected and the electricity market is guaranteed to 75 % .
there has not been a free consumer swit@@ ched to the current place .
in order to encourage competition and encourage the market penet@@ ration of alternative suppliers , the functions of electricity supply and distribution are legally and fun@@ ction@@ ally separated from the functions of electricity generation and sales .
the conditions for electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law .
I will build our common future and take global commitments , using only 1 % of their prosperity per year .
the focus of the fo@@ rec@@ lo@@ sure decisions is to respond to the invitation to our society in the interests of the better life of the EU citizens in today &apos;s world .
the European Parliament is the only one directly elected by the EU .
we will find information on this part of our web site , how Parliament will organise its work through a different committee system .
Parliament has an active role to play in drawing up legislation affecting the every@@ day life of its citizens , such as environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods , as well as the free movement of the European Union &apos;s annual budget .
the European Parliament is composed of 7@@ 36 members elected in the 27 Member States of the European Union .
since 19@@ 79 , MEPs have been elected in direct and universal elections for five years .
each Member State shall decide on what forms are organised , but must comply with the common democratic rule rules : gender equality and the secret vote .
in all Member States , 18 years of electoral rights , except Austria , where it is 16 years .
European elections are already governed by several key concepts : direct and general elections , proportionate representation and a five-@@ year term of office .
the general rule shall be distributed in proportion to the number of population in each Member State .
each Member State has a fixed number of cases – most 99 and less than 5 .
equality between men and women : the role of women in the European Parliament is increasing strongly .
it is now a little more than a third di@@ g of MEPs .
MEPs will share their time between Brussels , S@@ tras@@ bour@@ g and his district in Brussels , they participate in parliamentary committees and political groups , and in the plenary sessions of the House , they participate in the 12 plenary sessions .
with par@@ al@@ ysis , they must , of course , de@@ vote time to their circu@@ its .
members of the European Parliament will be group@@ ed in one of the political views , not by nationality .
they &apos;re using their mandate un@@ dependent .
as the European Parliament ’ s potential is increasing , they will affect all the citizens &apos; every@@ day life area : environmental , consumer protection , transport , and education , culture , health , etc .
the new Statute for Members of the European Parliament on 14 July 2009 , in the new sta@@ tute , is a new sta@@ tute for a more transparent and transparent EU budget for all members .
the European Parliament is equally important all the Community languages : all Parliament documents will be published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) and each member of the European Parliament .
what would be better to ensure the transparency and accessibility of Parliament &apos;s work throughout the public ?
in the European treaties , multilingu@@ alism , which is firmly roo@@ ted in the European treaties , is a cor@@ ner@@ stone of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes European institutions more accessible to public access and transparency , which will help to ensure the success of the EU &apos;s democratic system .
the European Parliament distingu@@ ish@@ es from other EU institutions to ensure a multilingu@@ alism in the largest possible way .
all EU citizens must be able to acqu@@ ain@@ t themselves with legislation directly affecting them in their national language .
and since every European citizen has the right to de@@ por@@ te the European Parliament in the elections , it is un@@ reasonable to require members of the members to be able to w@@ arm@@ ly over@@ wh@@ el@@ m .
each Member State shall be entitled to read the documents in their language , to monitor the deliber@@ ations and to take the floor clearly laid down in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure .
in addition , the European Parliament , as the legisla@@ tor , must ensure that all the legislative acts adopted are good in all official languages in all official languages .
in addition , the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament &apos;s work , ask questions and receive answers in their language .
the European Parliament in its resolution of 9 October states that &amp; quot ; experience gained from previous European elections and refer@@ enda shows that they are more likely to take part in those who are aware of the issues related to the EU and the participation of less infor@@ m@@ ised citizens are less likely ” .
on the eve of October 2009 , the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration &amp; quot ; Communic@@ ating Europe about Communic@@ ating Europe &amp; quot ; in order to emphasise the need for political pre@@ paredness for all EU institutions and Member States at all levels of the EU .
the main objective of the Joint Declaration is to provide citizens with a fair and multi-@@ fac@@ e@@ ted information on the EU , so that they can take active action in the public debate in the public debate .
with the Joint Declaration the EU took the task of resol@@ ving the problems in cooperation with Member States , in cooperation with the Member States , in order to ensure the right level of gender at the right level .
in this context , they expressed their desire to develop syn@@ the@@ sis of national , regional and local authorities and civil society representatives .
each Member State and each institution have their own communication tra@@ des and its priorities , agreed by Parliament , the Council and the Commission to establish a single set of communication priorities for a single year .
in addition , the Commission will be invited to provide feed@@ back to other EU institutions every year from the major achievements in implementing the previous year &apos;s communication priorities .
the European Union was hop@@ ed to end the frequent bloody w@@ ars of the neighbours , which became the Second Ma@@ il@@ lion War .

in the same 19@@ 57 , the Ro@@ oma Treaty establishes the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , or ‘ common market ’ .
in the 19@@ 60@@ s , the &amp; quot ; youth culture &amp; quot ; , the Be@@ at@@ les and other an@@ sa@@ mb@@ les will be s@@ pil@@ led across all the to@@ ol@@ teen@@ s of teen@@ ag@@ ers , encouraging the expansion of cultural re@@ volution and the expansion of generations between generations .
the economy is good in the economy , partly because EU countries will end customs duties on customs duties .
in addition , they impose joint control on food production , resulting in a sufficiently high degree of inno@@ c@@ ence and the main causes of agricultural products .
in May 19@@ 68 , the famous students of the Par@@ i@@ is@@ s and the 6@@ 68 con@@ sole@@ s will be ha@@ cked later to link many changes in society and human behaviour .
on 1 January 19@@ 73 , the number of members of the European Union will grow , if joining Ireland , Denmark and the United Kingdom .

in 19@@ 81 the EU will become Greece and five years later , Spain and Portugal will join .
in 19@@ 57 the Single European Act will be signed .
this agreement provides the basis for a comprehensive six-@@ year programme aimed at resol@@ ving the EU &apos;s cross-border free trade problems and desig@@ ning a common market .
the political sho@@ cks will lead to the col@@ lapse of the Berlin W@@ all by 9 November 19@@ 89 and the re@@ opening of the border between the I@@ da@@ -@@ and-@@ West Germany after 28 years .
the col@@ lapse of Commun@@ ism across Central and Eastern Europe strength@@ ens Europeans &apos; neighbourhood relations .
in 1991 , the creation of a common market , which is &amp; quot ; four fundamental freedoms &amp; quot ; , is to be set up in the free movement of goods , services , people and money .
in the 199@@ 0s , two new agreements will also be signed : the Treaty on European Union , or the M@@ aas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty in 1991 and the 1991 Treaty of A@@ m@@ s@@ ter@@ dam .
citizens feel increasingly concerned about protecting the environment , while looking for new opportunities for European security and defence .
the EU will receive three new lea@@ gues in 199@@ 5 , Austria , So@@ ome and Sweden .

many of the finding that Europe now has its own constitution , but it is far from easy to agree on , what kind of it should be and debate on the future of Europe will continue .
the single currency allows the price to be compared directly in all Member States that use it .
trans@@ -@@ national travel is simp@@ ler , as there is no more money exchange and poor .
in order to reduce the quality of the common market with a single market , the competition has led to a high level of quality and lower prices .
phone calls , inter@@ conne@@ ctor and air travel .
E@@ l prote@@ cts consumers from defec@@ tive and non-@@ quality products , whether the distance is purchased from home or other country .
E@@ l also establishes the highest standards of food safety .
citizens can live , work or reti@@ re in other EU countries .
temporary restrictions are abol@@ ished on the free movement of 12 new@@ est Member States .
over two million young people have been stu@@ dying or training the EU &apos;s programmes in the second European country .
thanks to this , each super@@ flu@@ ous and other lear@@ ner , which is E@@ ras@@ mus , Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do and others , are aware of the programmes of the cross-border partnership .
E@@ l does not decide what the school is nur@@ turing , but it is trying to ensure that the education and professional qualifications acquired in other EU countries are un@@ proble@@ matic .
the good whole of the environment is an important issue for Europeans and their governments .
the EU is therefore at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of efforts to protect and combat climate change .
as the pollution does not feel the limit , the EU has already been united in this area .
it is not surpris@@ ing that the ri@@ vers and be@@ aches of Europe are clean@@ er , cars pollu@@ ting less and in the area of waste management .
Europe &apos;s hazardous waste can no longer be transported to poor countries .
there are also strict EU rules to ensure the safety of chemicals used by companies and the environment .
the aim is to put transport , unemployment , agriculture and tourism into operation so that they do not destroy natural resources – other words that development would be savings .
in order to stop climate change , the EU has agreed on strict measures to reduce growth by 20 % by 2020 .
energy is the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the long-term climate policy of the EU and the EU has set binding targets for wind , hy@@ d@@ ro and solar energy and other clean renewable energy sources .
in addition to combating climate change , it will help to promote holdings and secure stable energy supply by reducing European depend@@ ency on foreign oil and gas imports .
E@@ l has already in@@ valida@@ ted the trading system for innovative pollution quotas , which many energy consum@@ ing companies can benefit from the reduction of energy consumption and will be fea@@ tured by businesses crossing the limit .
the euro ( € ) is expected to be one of the most popular achievements in the EU .
the single currency is 16 countries in use in 2009 , in which more than two thirds of the EU &apos;s population is living .
other countries will join if their economies are ready for this .
all the Euro@@ s and Euro@@ s can be used in all countries where the euro is turnover .
the pa@@ per@@ work is all kinds of common , co@@ inci@@ den@@ ces , but there is a common design on the other side of the country of origin .
the euro is in the following countries : Austria , Belgium , Spain , Hol@@ land , Ireland , Italy , Greece , Cy@@ pri@@ ot , Lu@@ k@@ semb@@ urg , Malta , Portugal , France , Germany , Slo@@ vak@@ kia , Slo@@ ve@@ enia , So@@ ome and the United Kingdom .
our societies are fa@@ irer and more efficient if we do not discrimin@@ ate against other people because of their nationality , the so@@ ils , the trees , the race or other speci@@ fici@@ ties .
the EU therefore prohi@@ bits discrimination .
already in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , the first EU agreements are a clear rule , men and women must receive equal pay for equal work .
with this , the EU was in the fight for women &apos;s rights and today they form an integral part of EU policies .
in order to win cross-border crime and terrorism , the EU has taken the pillars of the police and customs officials , the migration agencies and courts to ensure cooperation .
a single practical remedy is the European arrest warrant , which facilita@@ tes the introduction of suspected persons in the country where they are arrested , the country where they are to be investigated and prosecu@@ ted .
E@@ l countries are also in favour of asylum policy and strengthen control at EU external borders .
as EU citizens are entitled to live in all Member States , their rights must be protected in all EU countries .
the governments of the countries of the Member States must ensure that EU legislation is applied in the same way as in other Member States .
E@@ l has greatly facilita@@ ted cross-border justice , such as marriage , brea@@ kup , divorce , divorce and child care problems and other civil disputes .
new skills need and all we need to do is de@@ vote more time to learning .

the war between the EU countries is today un@@ thin@@ kable , thanks to the un@@ ity between countries over the last 50 years .
in view of this success , the EU now aims to promote peace and stability outside its borders .
the first and best way to avoid con@@ fli@@ cts is to increase prosperity throughout the world .
as the world &apos;s largest trade force uses its influence to establish fair rules in global trade .
E@@ l is trying to ensure that globalisation also benefits the poor countries .
today , the EU gives more humanitarian aid and development aid as someone else .
E@@ l will send military and police missions to the trou@@ bles , such as Bal@@ kan .
this is a political part of the EU &apos;s common foreign and security policy .
the European Union is an example of how to successfully comb@@ ine the economic and political resources of the democratic states in the common interest , both to the other regions of the world .

since the 50 years ago , when six foun@@ ding members came together , the European Union has constantly bre@@ ached the fla@@ mes and this process was cul@@ min@@ ated in 2004 and 2007 when the 15 members of the 27 members joined the cold war .

he wasn &apos;t the only son of his father , even though he was the ol@@ dest of the brothers , his brother Wil@@ lia@@ m in the cha@@ ir@@ woman of his business in C@@ u@@ c@@ ko@@ ld in his business .
in several parts of the M@@ ORGAN@@ s , but the M@@ ORGAN@@ s of the Ric@@ har@@ d cla@@ n , who thought they had mig@@ rated in the s@@ nee@@ zes , were already living in a sufficiently con@@ temp@@ t to achieve a sound position in order to achieve a sound position of the cla@@ n .
Richard &apos;s father wasn &apos;t one of them .
after a brief study of the primary school , he &apos;s in the ba@@ ker@@ y , and later , as a free man who has paid his tra@@ cks , he tried to stay in the face of the pu@@ mp@@ kin owner .
he was also organised socially appropriate , and Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t B@@ ig@@ gs came from a gang from B@@ ed@@ min@@ s@@ ter@@ ter from a gang of wealth , and he became a asset , including reading litera@@ cy .
kids , the first girl , you came to the weather with a sufficient frequency , so they &apos;re gonna have some dead pain and gri@@ ef .
if D@@ ick learned to rule so much to pull out before e@@ jac@@ ula@@ ting , the number of children stayed with two living sons and three girls .
a par@@ a p@@ aste , and a little small enough to care for more .
D@@ ick wanted at least one son to learn how to read and write , and his hopes focused on Richard when it was clear that two years ago , the no@@ ble wil@@ lia@@ m scho@@ ol@@ mate is not .
so if Richard had become seven years old , he was the Col@@ ston Po@@ is@@ s@@ las@@ te@@ school and had a famous blue coat that declared b@@ ris@@ tol@@ ans that his father was poor , but his father was hon@@ or@@ able .
and followed by five years of ta@@ mb@@ os@@ ke@@ dness and sk@@ ill skills .
he learned a hand@@ some hand to write , the dece@@ ased to calculate himself through the Ca@@ es@@ ar G@@ alli@@ a w@@ ars , C@@ ic@@ er@@ o calls and the O@@ vi@@ di@@ us Me@@ ta@@ mor@@ pho@@ sis , the s@@ cu@@ m of the cu@@ p@@ board .
because he was a good no@@ ble@@ man , a je@@ wel@@ ry from a distance , and a wh@@ i@@ ff of wh@@ i@@ ff of silence , he got out of the col@@ onel &apos;s ch@@ ari@@ table school from Col@@ ston .
at the age of 12 , it was time to leave the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned business , and to find a business or an invitation to work at the level of education .
however , for the great surprise of the sou@@ p , he chose not to have the same activities of the M@@ ORGAN@@ s .
his biggest for@@ gi@@ veness turned out to be a mechan@@ ic , a piece of pieces of things ; it was accompanied by an admi@@ rable pati@@ ence for a young man .
and on my own choice , he became a male boy at To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ t , who had a gun to his office .
my father had a decision on a quiet jo@@ y , he was sen@@ ten@@ cing that one of the M@@ organ@@ s growing into a cra@@ f@@ ts@@ man , not a long-@@ distance .
well , the war was part of life , and the war went off .
a man who pre@@ pa@@ res the weapon and repa@@ ired , didn &apos;t va@@ gue the threat of a battle in a c@@ ann@@ on .
for Ric@@ har@@ ď@@ s , seven years old , the se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-old is happy with the work and the season , the fear of physical pleasure .
like the other boys , he worked for a man &apos;s house , a house@@ kee@@ per &apos;s house , served him at the dinner table , filled the stomach with the lef@@ to@@ vers and slept on the ground .
fortuna@@ tely , the Lord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was a good host and even a better gun .
well , he was able to prepare the fab@@ ul@@ ous du@@ el@@ s and hunting guns , he had enough to understand that they had to be in Man@@ ton , but Man@@ ton couldn &apos;t be in Man@@ ton .
so was his work , the 4@@ 6-@@ in@@ ch c@@ ann@@ ons called &quot; P@@ ru@@ uni@@ ise B@@ essi@@ x &quot; in the war , and the 4@@ 6-@@ in@@ ch c@@ ann@@ ons , and still the sh@@ ell of the sun .
at the age of 11 , Richard became a master certificate and moved out of H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , but not his work@@ shop .
there he continued to work as a weapon of arms in P@@ ru@@ un@@ di B@@ es@@ side .
and he &apos;s hel@@ ple@@ ss , as long as the female bo@@ dy@@ guard in the bo@@ w@@ ls had been re@@ stored .
she became a daughter of his mother &apos;s brother , maybe the co@@ us@@ ins , but that In@@ g@@ lise &apos;s ra@@ ck , he was not in the face of his girlfriend .
the marriage was arran@@ ged , but there was a love of love between the w@@ ives of years in gold .
the je@@ wel@@ ry represented some confusion about the son of Richard M@@ organ@@ s and Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t Bri@@ g@@ gs , Richard Mor@@ gan , who took his own wife to Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t Bri@@ g@@ gs .
as long as H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s cra@@ w@@ led with a full ra@@ mp , there was nothing strange , because young couple of e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws in the re@@ p@@ ent cor@@ ren@@ ess of A@@ von St@@ ree@@ k , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ t Street , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , and Je@@ wish sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue , were a long-@@ distance stone .
the marriage was signed in 17@@ 67 , three years after the end of the se@@ ven@@ -@@ year war with France , and the victory in debt , despite hard debt , was to increase the taxes and dra@@ g the money in order to increase the co@@ ca@@ ine .
there was no need for weapons , so you left me@@ is@@ ters and the boys in the ha@@ un@@ ted H@@ ab@@ ita@@ t from the Je@@ w , until all the companies were still in Richard and Lord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s .
and then , for some time after the little M@@ ary was born in 17@@ 70 , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant to let Richard &apos;s pri@@ de .
&quot; for me to work , &quot; Du@@ de , D@@ ick Mor@@ gan .
&quot; the weapons are coming and go , but the rum remains . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened , despite the problem .
Ric@@ har@@ di &apos;s mother was always called short of Ma@@ g and Richard &apos;s wife Pe@@ g , both derived from Mar@@ ga@@ ret .
the bigger problem was that all the men of In@@ g@@ lis@@ land , if you were to find out about the pro@@ test@@ ants , who were b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed into C@@ ran@@ fi@@ el@@ ds and O@@ ne@@ si@@ ph@@ or@@ us , were the name of John , Wil@@ lia@@ m , Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ tes , E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ eth@@ s , and all the women .
it was one of the few things that were fit for everyone , the King &apos;s ten@@ sion .
&amp; quot ; This is the first time I see this . &amp; quot ;
that h@@ ali@@ p@@ so@@ s di@@ ving di@@ ver who was in the face of an evil investi@@ g@@ ator at the bottom of the s@@ tern , and got the word out of the mouth .
he took the lad@@ der to the lad@@ der , took the fla@@ mes and the mask down and hand them to the waiting ferry .
then he dra@@ gged himself out of the water , losing a balance in the cy@@ lin@@ ders &apos; gra@@ vity of the b@@ all@@ ast , but lan@@ ded on the ground as a whole , and a whole ship on deck .
there was a dri@@ p in the middle of a bunch of other cre@@ ws who were already waiting on the di@@ ving deck .
Jack Ho@@ ward went down from the bridge and laugh@@ ed at the war .
he still couldn &apos;t believe that such a bo@@ dy@@ work would be able to move the water net from the water .
the T@@ ag@@ a@@ deck di@@ ving gear in tac@@ tics opened his mouth , a lovely year in the old one .
&amp; quot ; And we thought you were sw@@ im@@ ming back to Ath@@ ens and sitting with the gin and the cha@@ u@@ ff@@ e@@ ur of your father &apos;s pool . &amp; quot ;
the study is not based on cli@@ matic cali@@ bra@@ tions , forecasts or personal opinions , but has assemb@@ led many sources , including inter@@ views , ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , orientation and hearing .
all data prior to 199@@ 0s based on inter@@ views based on inter@@ views and multi@@ fac@@ e@@ ted news@@ papers , news@@ papers and history of news@@ papers – more precise use of information collection methods used in earlier use .
the gra@@ ph@@ ics of the period after 1988 are based on everything that has taken place over the last 11 years and what I have been reading about about 1000 different studies .
the 2009 and next year &apos;s gra@@ gra@@ phi@@ c is based on forecasts from me and others for the years ahead .
gra@@ ph@@ ics are not pre@@ ten@@ ding to be a 100 % prec@@ ision , their aim is to provide a review of the situation and to out@@ line the social media news , targeted communication and other such future .
the purpose of the article is to make people think .
we are currently seeing a completely new way of communic@@ ating people - that makes traditional vo@@ ters simp@@ ler .
this is a fundamental change that changes the world , which we feel , fully .
the best thing about this is to help you get this happen .
come along with me to the last 2@@ 10@@ -@@ year-old .
before we start expl@@ oring the future , we &apos;ll look at how we made it today , starting with the fact that we &apos;re going back to 18@@ 00 , where finding the inf@@ o was in the s@@ wing .
in the 18@@ 00@@ s , people have to go out and meet them .
everything was a fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face attitude .
for the sale of the product , you should have gone to the local market and the only possibility to communicate in a general pla@@ in was to meet personal or rif@@ le table .
it meant for you that it was right at the right time to obtain information or to provide it .
you didn &apos;t know what happened in the second part of the city , nor did your products sell to people in another place .
they were told about some new contra@@ ception called news@@ paper ...
by 19@@ 00 , history and maga@@ z@@ ines have changed atti@@ tudes , allowing us to get news of places where we never had .
we were able to communicate our ideas to people we never saw , and sell his products to others who were far away .
we still have to go out and talk to other people , but we got to be in the middle of nowhere .
it was incredible - the first real re@@ volution .
the world began to open .
since 19@@ 20 , a new source of information on the people of the pa@@ per@@ work - the book .
the ab@@ rup@@ t audi@@ ence has heard the voice of another person from hundreds of miles .
but the most important thing was that the latest information was possible in the real time .
it was the next food in the history of information .
however , the fra@@ u@@ dul@@ ent time of development meant that , in 19@@ 60 , the history of our lives in the 19@@ 60 d@@ omi@@ ci@@ led lives .
if you wanted to get the latest news , or introduce people to your products , you would have used the history of this history .
it felt that these are the V@@ AL@@ D@@ A@@ VA@@ S for a very long time .
this situation started to change in 19@@ 60 .
in the frame of the book , and two main sources of information were broad@@ cast in the history of the news , the more detailed news transmitted by news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines and maga@@ z@@ ines .
it was a great time for me@@ dia , although some said that the history of the history of the news@@ paper would be able to take the right time , the argument that we could have heard in a repeated 50 years .
during the next 40 years , the next fac@@ t-@@ based evolution was presented .
it started to collect public interest in the 19@@ 60@@ s and the beginning of the 199@@ 0s was a big , de@@ ser@@ ting news@@ paper , and maga@@ z@@ ines , but the d@@ om@@ ine@@ er still in the frame .
now , people got inf@@ il@@ tra@@ ted as well as watching .
the year 19@@ 70 was also the time when the publish@@ ers of news@@ papers realized that something was horri@@ bly wrong with their sales market .
they had a lot of problems with the dra@@ in , but there was another way out of the class .
only two years later , and the preval@@ ence of transmission was domin@@ ated by the information world , the defo@@ res@@ tation was almost only the &amp; quot ; place where it was to be heard of the music &amp; quot ; and the history of all that was able to remain appropriate .
the constant development of technology continued with persis@@ tence , never seen before .
the new phenomenon was sp@@ ying on the sha@@ dows .
1998 was the year when the Internet changed from a w@@ ron@@ g@@ ful place , which had not much significance , in@@ definitely , leading to attitude that every company must have a website .
the re@@ volution has started three years earlier , but in 1998 it reached a critical mass and tried to draw attention to all the attention , despite the fact that there was a lack of access to it .
however , everyone agreed that it was the future - a new era of timing .
it was a place where everyone could have inf@@ il@@ tra@@ ted information everywhere - at least theory .
people started to realize the Internet was more than just inf@@ o .
when you joined the interview , you got something back and being part of it instead of being a monitor .
however , the most important thing was that you could choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it .
the Internet options were up@@ gra@@ ded .
in 2004 , only six years later , the Internet had changed the way we took the information .
however , there was a d@@ omi@@ cile and history in our news sources , but the world was certainly the Internet .
people have made new websites and dis@@ solved the world of online applications .
people were able to do so much and participate in so many areas in order to show a new reci@@ pe : inf@@ o over@@ load .
for the first time in my life , we are more information than we can be able to absor@@ b .
in the age of history , we were to choose what we wanted to see .
in 2004 , we must choose what we did not want to see .
it had a de@@ structive effect on the traditional image of inf@@ o .
it was possible to get people &apos;s attention just to do something .
people wanted more choice , so they just had to give them a new choice .
this change in 2004 , because something different was not enough , it was supposed to be better .
2004 was also a year when another phen@@ om@@ ena began to emer@@ ge :
this reci@@ pe was silent on the plane blo@@ gs .
it was a mild , simple and accessible way to share your ideas .
for the first time , everyone had a chance to create their own inf@@ os@@ ter@@ ist , without anything technical .
the treatment of inf@@ o is a change of professional work for all workers .
three years later , and the Internet social element , the social element of the Internet was in fact .
for the first time there was no more information on inf@@ o , and history was fought for survival .
everyone wanted to create his little world and connect it to their own friends .
2007 was also a breaking point for traditional websites that people compared to the history of history - a sta@@ tic and pas@@ sive form of information .
we want an active information .
we want to be part of this , not just to look at it .
blo@@ gs started to get into difficulty .
as was the case in the course of the race , it had been removed from the defo@@ res@@ tation ( because it was better and more ri@@ cher for the people in the ra@@ dar ) , so the social networks removed the blo@@ gs .
the social profile is more active for people to share what they care about .
social networks are just better for this , and blo@@ gs can &apos;t stay behind it .
two years later , today , the new Internet is going to absor@@ b our world completely .
history is dead in the water and people are looking less at the same time as they do .
we are the new ar@@ ts of inf@@ o , using social networking sites to contact and communicate .
even the traditional website will die , which has been killed by a continuous flow of information from the social networks to the ru@@ th@@ less flow of information .
over the last 2@@ 10 years , we have seen a fas@@ cin@@ ating development , how we can obtain information .
the main pillars are :
1 .
2 . getting it in the real time .
3 , seeing it in the real time .
4 . decision to look at something and watch .
5 . possibility to take part and c@@ andy .
6 .
7 .
2009 is the beginning of the next re@@ volution .
all we know is changing .
the first and most dra@@ matic change is a reci@@ pe for social news .
it will take over our need to be in the course of what happens in the world .
the news will no longer pass the maga@@ z@@ ines , because now it comes from everyone .
they will be sent directly to you , leaving the traditional di@@ etary channels .
instead of the time wri@@ ter , what the analy@@ sts say , the moon is now in his own hands .
the social news will get the news straight and un@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship .
a new enter@@ tainment wave ( blu@@ e@@ print and pur@@ ple bot@@ tles ) which are d@@ omi@@ ci@@ led in games , video and he@@ le@@ flows .
instead of making a TV channel , you decide what you want to look at and when you want to watch it .
we &apos;re not going to join the channels anymore where someone else decides what we can look at .
you &apos;re checking all the experience .
in the form of an inf@@ la@@ tionary information , the new concept is silent .
we already see a growing number of mobile telep@@ hon@@ y services that provide local information on this area where you are located .
for example , instead of pointing out all the world &apos;s restaur@@ ants , the phone only shows the list in your area .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to grow up in the next years .
in the world where we have access to more information than we can consu@@ me , it is a very important element of obtaining relevant information , exp@@ anding much further than a long distance , which we see today .
within the next five or ten years , the world will change .
all traditional forms will eventually die .
the tem@@ po@@ ral tem@@ po@@ ral history is no longer ex@@ er@@ ted , the distribution of the current channels in the form of the current channels is replaced by individual programmes that you wish to see .
the audi@@ o programmes are intended to be replaced by po@@ ckets and video broadcas@@ ts .
websites have a much smaller role : their primary function is the distribution of operational activities that can be done in a different way , where people can be able to use raw materials elsewhere .
many websites and summer networks join one .
social news , as described above , will get the V@@ AL@@ D@@ A@@ VA@@ S to take the people .
traditional maga@@ z@@ ines will be completely , because people get inf@@ o directly from the original .
everyone is a potential repor@@ ter , but the new advantages of the use of target groups will eliminate most of the my@@ ste@@ ries .
the maga@@ z@@ ines become ed@@ itors who instead , instead of communic@@ ating the news , bring together a larger picture of us .
the future news flow is person@@ alised and it is constantly changing according to what you look at , much in the same way L@@ ast@@ .@@ f@@ m is doing music today .
each form shall contain a target group .
you have control over each individual information that moves towards you .
two new contra@@ cep@@ tives will start in 2010 .
one of them is an inte@@ ri@@ or inf@@ o , where information flows can involve parts of various sources of news , not just in pla@@ in data , but by bringing it together , sharing it by divi@@ ding them and highlighting valuable parts .
instead of reading the five different articles that are written on the same subject , you will be given one , highlighting important interest points .
how secure are your Christmas lights ?
the EL@@ -@@ EU tests show the per@@ ks of the electric shock of the floo@@ ding and fire control .
stay safe , sp@@ lin@@ ter them out when the house of the ne@@ arest bed or light@@ ning .
the market investigation carried out by the Commission has shown that the com@@ pac@@ t of the Christmas fire tested every third week had a risk of fire or electric shock .
tests via the Sak@@ har@@ ov , Hungary , the Netherlands , Slo@@ ve@@ eni@@ as and Slo@@ vaks and Slo@@ vaks in all the price categories .
samples were inspe@@ cted over more than 20 requirements and many of them were through more than one test .
the Commission found a high level of w@@ iring , weak management and poor iso@@ lation on many fla@@ gs .
only more than 40 % of the samples were prepared in China .
in Hungary , almost 96 % of the lamps are dangerous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % of the EU security standards did not respond .
although only five countries took part in the study , it is likely that the light lights are sold across the EU .
Commissioner for Consumer Protection Mag@@ len@@ a K@@ une@@ va said that the results were to be wa@@ ived .
he strongly advised the EU Member States to work better on security requirements and said that unemployment ( producers , selle@@ rs , he@@ als and importers ) should also make control more effective .
in the case of customers , he stressed vigilance , offering the following advice :
it is expected that the S@@ to@@ ck@@ hol@@ m commit@@ s some 4 000 participants from 1 5@@ 00@@ -@@ 1 organisation in which the EU &apos;s efforts to make development more effective are being presented .
&amp; quot ; Citiz@@ ens and development &amp; quot ; under the &amp; quot ; Citiz@@ ens &amp; quot ; focus will focus on the impact of this year on the impact on the economic down@@ turn of glo@@ ba@@ al warming and poor countries .
although they are usually the last ones to blame , they are particularly affected by the economic down@@ turn and climate change .
the truth of the sea level , de@@ serti@@ fication and increased frequency and the more serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and un@@ expected development goals in the thousands of years .
and the current economic climate has led to the reduction of assisting don@@ ations for developing countries , reducing food guaran@@ tors in the most vulnerable areas .
bringing together politicians , public authorities , NGOs , business leaders , acade@@ mics , researchers and me@@ dia , offer the European Ar@@ en@@ gement Day to establish relations , sharing experiences and to find new partners for development projects .
the three days of the Middle East , which starts by 22 October , includes training , discussion sessions and work@@ shops .
&amp; quot ; The ar@@ sen@@ al &amp; quot ; provides organisations with the opportunity to introduce themselves to dele@@ gates and public disclosure and to increase awareness of their objectives .
a series of developments related to development , including the L@@ or@@ en@@ z@@ o Na@@ ta@@ li Prize for Human Rights , will be shared with a number of developments in the development of human rights , democracy and development .
the youth development premium goes for teen@@ ag@@ ers or vide@@ os , showing human development in Africa .
in October , the EU will also make the first European progress report on the fence .
this will constitute a discussion of the place of dispatch to the EU approach towards the African countries of the EU .
E@@ l gives more than half of the development aid .
the conver@@ ter of A@@ bi@@ and@@ ers will send strong signals to support Geor@@ gia .
until late time , Geor@@ gi@@ as was the fas@@ test economy in the world - 12 % growth in 2007 .
it was a change in the shor@@ tage of Russia in a short , but short con@@ f@@ essor .
key transport lines and u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties were damaged , fri@@ gh@@ tened , and houses turned into stone cli@@ cks and po@@ ms destroyed large forests .
more than two months later , many foreign investors have left , tour@@ ists have disappeared , unemployment has been proven and many ge@@ or@@ gi@@ ans have emp@@ tied their banks .
the Ma@@ a@@ il@@ ma@@ pan@@ a is now predi@@ cting that Geor@@ gia , the power of energy sources Europe needs EUR 2.4 billion for recovery .
over the next three years the EU has committed EUR 500 million and the US has promised EUR 7@@ 57 million ( 1 billion dollars ) , over half of this year .
the E@@ l and Ma@@ a@@ il@@ ma@@ pan@@ k have taken a conference of donors on 22 October to meet the remaining EUR 1.1 billion .
it was called 70 countries and institu@@ tes .
the aid will support the over@@ night works and help the Government of Geor@@ gia to satisfy the first needs of those people who are dro@@ pping their homes .
tens of thousands of people were re@@ settled , many of them still bra@@ in@@ stor@@ med in brain ti@@ ts .
but the lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term objective is to re@@ build the economy of Geor@@ gia , which has carried out major changes in the last years .
&amp; quot ; It is important that the crisis does not lead to Geor@@ gi@@ ia &apos;s political and economic reform , which is now more important than the summer of the con@@ f@@ essor , Ben@@ ita Fer@@ re@@ ro@@ -@@ Wal@@ d@@ ner .
the former Council of So@@ vi@@ ets will normally receive around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union .
between Geor@@ gia and Russia , there is dis@@ agreement about the L@@ ap@@ -@@ O@@ s@@ se@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ as@@ ia - two left of Geor@@ gia &apos;s provin@@ ce , which Russia recognises as self-@@ state .
the two sides of the G@@ ene@@ vas will have to go on 15 October and will continue in November in November , under the aus@@ pic@@ es of the UN and the European Medi@@ ators .
this enabled the EU &apos;s Ob@@ ser@@ vers to move to the ce@@ ase@@ fire to monitor the ce@@ ase@@ fire .
thousands of Russian soldiers have left the separ@@ at@@ ists .
the European model was awarded for a well-@@ selling debate .
the ten new stars share the spo@@ t@@ light on this year &apos;s European B@@ order B@@ rea@@ kers A@@ wards .
in recognition of success in the wider audi@@ ence , European A@@ wards are pri@@ zes for mu@@ les whose bu@@ b@@ bles are well sold in the European Union ( exc@@ l .

a crime that contains presen@@ tations of current and previous win@@ ners is the evening of Brit@@ ish T@@ V T@@ rou@@ ble Jo@@ ols Hol@@ land .
now , in your sixth year , the prize is international success and the support of the European music industry , which provides some 600 000 people .

one of the win@@ ners of the last year was So@@ ome ro@@ ck@@ b@@ ras@@ s , the S@@ un@@ ris A@@ venue , which was victory for his &quot; The Wa@@ y to W@@ on@@ der@@ land &quot; .

&amp; quot ; We are very confi@@ dent that it will help the future of the gang . &amp; quot ;
the C@@ ann@@ es f@@ esti@@ val of the year 2008 shows the success of the EU-@@ funded films in the world .
four@@ teen films , which have partly supported the EU ’ s me@@ dia@@ dian programme , have been selected in 61 international film f@@ esti@@ vals .
the F@@ il@@ mi@@ f@@ esti@@ vals are no longer financed by the EU , and millions of people have seen millions of people .
the EU-@@ 15 Me@@ dia Programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of a m@@ ali@@ ce through film .
however , Europe &apos;s film@@ makers are confron@@ ted with major calls both internationally and at home .
in the 19@@ th May , the Sixth European Day in C@@ ann@@ es , representatives of the EU are sitting together with the European film ministers and with the European film ministers , to discuss how the audiovisual industry is to be able to engage in greater international cooperation .
the aim is to expand content circu@@ lating in other parts of the world and to cooperate more closely with other films outside the EU .
this international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films .
the C@@ ann@@ es f@@ esti@@ val of the previous year contained some of the films financed by the EU@@ -@@ Me@@ dia Me@@ dia Programme .
and in the beginning of this year , many of the EU ’ s F@@ il@@ ms ( e.g. The Coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ i@@ ters and L@@ a M@@ ô@@ me ) were presented to the O@@ sc@@ ari@@ ans .
four@@ teen films financed by the EU@@ -@@ funded film C@@ ann@@ es 2008 were : G@@ om@@ or@@ ra , D@@ el@@ ta , L@@ a fron@@ ti@@ è@@ re de l &apos;@@ Au@@ be , L@@ e sil@@ ence de L@@ or@@ na , The Pal@@ er@@ m@@ o S@@ hoo@@ ting , The Pal@@ er@@ m@@ o , El@@ dor@@ ad@@ o de Di@@ e@@ u li@@ zz@@ re , Sal@@ am@@ and@@ ra , L@@ es fron@@ ti@@ ère , The Pal@@ er@@ m@@ o S@@ hoo@@ ting , The Pal@@ er@@ m@@ o , El@@
in the EU-@@ China Summit on 20 May , in Pra@@ gue , the climate change , financial crises and economic atti@@ tudes .
E@@ l and China signed agreements to expand cooperation with knowledge and technology , clean energy and small business .
again , they reaffir@@ med their dedi@@ cation to the project to develop technology to produce electricity from the coal to the CO@@ 2 un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling , which is the root of the glo@@ ba@@ cial warming .
two sides discussed the debate on international climate change debate in K@@ open@@ ha@@ agent .
E@@ l recommends that the economy , such as China , severely restric@@ ts the CO@@ 2 issue by offering financial support from the developed countries .
with regard to the financial crisis , the EU and China agreed that the international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic ris@@ es and the emergence of more pron@@ oun@@ ced and ar@@ thri@@ tive economies in these institutions .
on top of the top level negotiations , two sides stressed trade and investment as keys to economic recovery .
two sides also discussed the human rights situation in Ti@@ bet and the S@@ ri Lan@@ k@@ al , Af@@ gan@@ ist@@ anis and Pakistan - three countries where China has a significant impact .

the Prime Minister of Latvia than@@ ked the S@@ MA Uni@@ on for the recognition of the recognition and the contribution made to the development of an efficient business environment in Europe .
V@@ . D@@ om@@ bro@@ v@@ sk@@ is stressed that the S@@ MA Uni@@ on network has contributed to the idea that , in Latvia , micro@@ economic support measures were to be implemented .
the government has taken steps not only to ensure a fis@@ cal sustainability , but has also developed a support programme for the micro-@@ economic economy aimed at reducing barriers to micro-@@ economic activity and encouraging unemployed people to start their business .
in order to achieve the objective , the government has taken a decision to reduce the company ’ s free capital requirements and registration costs , simplified tax information and accounting processes and ensure financial support for micro-@@ economic operations .
in its speech , the Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are a driving force in the economy , contributing to the reduction of unemployment , long-term development and stability .
we have already announced that , on the dates of 8@@ -@@ 10 December , the Prime Minister will attend Mr Val@@ dis D@@ om@@ bro@@ vskis , Prime Minister Val@@ dis D@@ om@@ bro@@ vskis , at the Con@@ gress of the European People &apos;s Party , Germany .

the exchange of information corresponds to the model of cooperation established by the government and non-governmental bodies representing the joint responsibility for social economic situation in the country , Latvia and their impact on future developments .
the reform group has set priorities for these challenges , focusing directly on the competitiveness , growth and recovery of the country &apos;s economy .
the group stresses that the assessment of the key functions that will be carried out , which will be carried out and the ra@@ tional use of potential sources of public budgets has made progress in determining the reduction of funding in accordance with the performance of tasks and the assessment of functions aimed at ending the reduction of the line@@ ar financing .
although agreement was reached on objectives - small and effective administration , expansion of internal and external markets in Latvia and promoting employment - shared the general opinion of the Group on the need to continue to work towards a clearer framework for the future structural reforms .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ administration Group believes that it is necessary to continue the active enforcement of social security measures , measures which are included in economic recovery plans aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and encouraging investment , measures to support the launch of micro-@@ economic activities and to support the launch of the business .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ administration Group has agreed to make the EU ’ s programmes more rapid , which has been delayed during the current period of five years , and the group will also consider that the average budget should be implemented by allo@@ cating the budget to the operational and development budget by linking the external market to future development priorities .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ administration Group was hop@@ ed in July 2009 with a view to ensuring a public participation in the budget reduction and decision-making .

my order number is AF@@ 2@@ 6@@ 16@@ 8@@ 15@@ 6 .
to solve the problem , I would like you to take over a cash amount of money that they asked for .
I &apos;ve already gone and bought a new pot of shoes from the local sports store , so the result of sending another boat would have two pa@@ irs of shoes like that .
thank you for reading this letter for time .
I &apos;ve been a happy customer of your company many years and this is the first time I &apos;ve encountered a problem .

it will send two pro@@ ton spe@@ eds , partic@@ les , which are ja@@ m@@ med into the a@@ at@@ om@@ ic family , which belong to the families of the partic@@ les , in different direc@@ tions along the lines of 27 km , which are located under Switzerland and France .
in order to speed up the pro@@ tons and to ensure that they are closed to the he@@ el , strong magnetic fields are required , these fields are produced by the super@@ conduc@@ tors , materials which are capable of generating electricity without barriers or energy loss and which are produced in cooperation with European industry .
the pro@@ ton col@@ lis@@ ion is going on at a speed of two-@@ as@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ x million times in a to@@ ol@@ box of energy wholesale .
in order to understand the magni@@ tude of the magni@@ tude of this , 1 TE@@ V is about this energy wholesale , which is useful for moving to the mo@@ dest savings .
but in the L@@ H@@ C , it will be assemb@@ led by a million times less than a little less than this bu@@ g .
as energy can be transferred to partic@@ les in accordance with the limited rela@@ tivity of the mass of mass energy , ( E = m@@ c@@ 2 ) , physi@@ cs are expected to create a partic@@ le that has never been vie@@ wed in the accele@@ ra@@ tors before .
the frequency and intensi@@ fi@@ ance of the pig@@ e@@ ons is important because they make it possible to see the partic@@ les of partic@@ les more visible .
there are two main nuclear spe@@ eds , which energy c@@ and@@ les 1 150 to Te@@ v , but a lot of col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons .
for the super@@ -@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ...
certain anch@@ ors are capable of analy@@ sing a col@@ lapse .
the two names are C@@ MS ( Com@@ pac@@ t Mu@@ on S@@ ol@@ en@@ o@@ id ) and At@@ las ( A To@@ ro@@ ida@@ l L@@ H@@ C Ap@@ para@@ tus ) .
they &apos;re concentra@@ ting on super sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal partic@@ les and H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ on@@ ite .
what &apos;s super sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ?
partic@@ le physi@@ cs contains several sy@@ m@@ me@@ tries , such as matter and anti@@ matter .
Su@@ per@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try bin@@ ds fer@@ mi@@ on ( the star@@ ter to the matter for the matter , such as electricity and var@@ n@@ ish@@ es ) every b@@ os@@ with ( channel@@ ling the transfer , such as fo@@ il ) and reverse .
the invitation is that the super@@ inten@@ dent super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ( also determined ) has never been seen before .
how do you get them ?
par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , through their absence !
&quot; it &apos;s a little like being a movie .
you &apos;re counting on the number of people entering the in@@ coming and the light@@ ning .
if any person has disappeared at the end of this , because you know who entered , he can guess who did not . ”
in the same way , the L@@ H@@ C examin@@ ers are aware that the results of certain col@@ ours should arise from the anti@@ ques that are in@@ visible to all an@@ idu@@ rs .
knowing the energy of partic@@ les before the col@@ lapse , they shall compare the energy of the partic@@ les after the col@@ lapse .
if there are differences in energy , a part has been affected .
by calculating the missing energy , they will know whether the com@@ pass of super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try or anti@@ ques is involved .
the second invitation of the C@@ MS and the L@@ H@@ S anch@@ ors is the ans@@ w@@ ering of H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ on@@ ite .
as regards the focus of the standard model theory , it is expected that it should be inter@@ face with partic@@ les and give them mas@@ ses .
how ?
let &apos;s assume there &apos;s a to@@ wel@@ s of physi@@ cs .
suddenly , Al@@ bert E@@ inste@@ in , the stu@@ b@@ born , is going to take him around , and he &apos;s going to give her questions .
when Al@@ bert is trying to move , he feels certain in@@ er@@ ts because of his cold cl@@ ot@@ h .
he &apos;s a s@@ nit@@ ch to those partic@@ les when H@@ ig@@ gs b@@ os@@ on@@ ons try to have a reci@@ pro@@ cal effect on them - they collect mas@@ ses .
here too , their famous b@@ os@@ on@@ ite a@@ il@@ ment can only be indirect : the partic@@ les that result in their la@@ min@@ ation , they are what is being discovered .
K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ g@@ lu@@ oni sou@@ p
the third carrier which L@@ H@@ C is equipped with is called A@@ li@@ ce ( a large ion chip ex@@ peri@@ ment ) .
it is intended to detect un@@ familiar nuclear physi@@ cs , especially in the matter of matter , which exis@@ ted in a very short period of time after S@@ uur@@ k P@@ au@@ ku , and what known as the state of the g@@ ala@@ xy .
what &apos;s the new speci@@ ality ?
in the 19@@ 60@@ s , the scientists , the pro@@ tons and the neutr@@ ali@@ zed , which formed an a@@ at@@ om@@ ic core , were made even more of the indi@@ gen@@ ous partic@@ les .
these win@@ dows are strong forces ( which are channel@@ led by the parts with the names of the g@@ lu@@ on@@ ons ) .
for their one , it is that they are diverse together : they are always either in pa@@ irs or tri@@ bes ; they cannot be ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t .
the more you try to iso@@ late K@@ var@@ k from the other k@@ ick@@ -@@ off , the bigger the ri@@ vers that keep them together , the al@@ al@@ ally un@@ separ@@ able .
they say they &apos;re in prison .
however , if pro@@ tons are to be ban@@ ned against each other , the sou@@ p and the sou@@ p containing the g@@ lu@@ ons will be created , which can be free to move .
then we can get to the clearing of the k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le g@@ lu@@ on sou@@ p .
what kind of release ?
&amp; quot ; This is a pa@@ per@@ work comparable to the ski .
if there &apos;s not much fly , the tra@@ cks can be separated by gras@@ s and ski sla@@ ves are limited to their path .
from the other side , if there &apos;s a lot of flying , they can change the path .
they are free from restrictions . &amp; quot ;
instead of the s@@ now , physi@@ cs include energy : what the higher energy is , the weak@@ er of the power , so it can be separated at a high level of energy .
the plasma presence of K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ g@@ lu@@ on was likely to be a matter of ma@@ matter after S@@ uur@@ k P@@ au@@ ku .
it &apos;s a reason why physi@@ cs want to study the i@@ ion@@ ic ir@@ ons created by the L@@ H@@ C .
they &apos;re very rich in pro@@ ton and neutr@@ on .
they can achieve energy 1 150 TE@@ V , which is necessary for the plasma , which was un@@ prec@@ eden@@ ted in the original shape of Uni@@ ver@@ su@@ m , to create and investigate .
anti@@ matter my@@ ster@@ y
finally , the last anch@@ or named L@@ H@@ C@@ b ( a large H@@ ad@@ ron accele@@ ra@@ tor ) .
its task is to better monitor the small differences between the matter and the anti@@ matter of matter so that it can be better understood what happened to the anti@@ matter of the universe .
for each partic@@ le , the anti@@ do@@ te is the same as the same mas@@ ses , but the counter@@ part .
for this reason , there is a negative mass of electricity available for electricity , but the anti@@ Elec@@ tr@@ on ( or posi@@ tioning ) of the positive charge ( or posi@@ tioning ) .
when the electricity and anti@@ elec@@ tr@@ on get together , they &apos;re going to be de@@ vasta@@ ting from each other , for me .
according to the standard model of the partic@@ le physi@@ cs , the universe was expected to be equal to the matter and anti@@ matter .
after all , all units should destroy each other and the universe should be empty .
however , as anyone can see , the matter is ro@@ tte@@ n .
this is a place where the question of what L@@ H@@ C@@ b is trying to answer : where is anti@@ matter ?
one possible response is based on the ability of certain partic@@ les to alter themselves as their counter@@ parts and counter@@ parts .
in this case , the presence of the matter depends on the hypo@@ the@@ sis ( which is expected to demonstrate ) that the conversion of anti@@ partic@@ les into partic@@ les is dependent on the opposite transformation of the universe .
can this im@@ balance be demonstrated ?
this is actually an ex@@ peri@@ mental vie@@ w@@ point with a partic@@ le type , which will be called for the on@@ board .
the An@@ tic@@ a@@ ons are trans@@ formed into a s@@ pr@@ ing@@ on , but the opposite is much less frequent .
L@@ H@@ C@@ b is investi@@ gating another candidate , B bee@@ kee@@ per , containing ( among other things ) an element ( or an anti@@ que ) which is called a B qu@@ ake or a c@@ un@@ ning ( where is the L@@ CH@@ B ) .
although the partic@@ le can &apos;t be seen , it &apos;s possible .
for this purpose , L@@ H@@ C has been equipped with a device containing several con@@ cen@@ tric tri@@ cks ( such as oni@@ on ) , which s@@ peaks of a partic@@ le speed where the col@@ lapse occurs .
every la@@ yer speci@@ ali@@ zes in finding a certain type of thing .
the anch@@ or &apos;s center has a chamber , inside the chamber , there are millions of drivers that produce power pul@@ se when a part goes against .
these im@@ pul@@ sions are conver@@ ted by compu@@ ters .
there &apos;s a mag@@ net in every anch@@ or .
this will help to detect and investigate the tra@@ jec@@ tories of the loaded partic@@ les ( e.g. electricity or pro@@ ton ) which are sensitive to the magnetic field .
second , the cal@@ ori@@ fic device is a cal@@ ori@@ fic device .
some cal@@ ories stop such partic@@ les , such as phot@@ ons or elec@@ tr@@ ons , but others are designed to stop neutr@@ ons and phot@@ ons .
they measure the energy loss of the partic@@ les .
aid from st@@ ring
how to define the nature of al@@ go@@ sa@@ kes@@ tes separated from mechanisms that lead to their creation ?
in addition to the standard model of partic@@ le physi@@ cs ( which is the result of the pos@@ tu@@ la@@ tu@@ ans of the qu@@ a@@ il@@ man ) , today &apos;s science has concentrated its hopes entirely on a new common concept that would offer a high level of ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical st@@ ring theory .
it exten@@ ds the out@@ look to making a completely new type of ex@@ peri@@ men@@ tes@@ y in C@@ ER@@ N .
the standard models ( the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the complex physi@@ cs used in the 20th century ) must be the main element of the basic component , driven by a known basic interaction between the three partic@@ les and the strong and weak river .
it will allow us to provide descri@@ ptions that fit very well with what is going on in this end@@ less@@ ly small world .
however , it does not take into account the four interactions - gra@@ vity .
now , physi@@ cs , when the protein presents itself with a partic@@ le , pho@@ bia , by means of gra@@ vity , the gra@@ vity effect must be transferred to another partic@@ le , gra@@ vit@@ on .
the focus of harmonisation
this is why there is an obstacle ( see bo@@ x@@ ing ) on the basis of this standard model .
in addition , the Uni@@ verse was such that the Uni@@ verse was very small as well as ex@@ on@@ er@@ ous ( all energy and matter concentrated in a very small area ) .
by expos@@ ing the theory to a partic@@ le that previously d@@ omi@@ ci@@ led during this period , gra@@ vity cannot be left aside .
so how do you connect all of this to the general rela@@ tivity theory ( E@@ inste@@ in in the original sa@@ us@@ ages ) , which turns completely around gra@@ vity ?
&amp; quot ; Fro@@ m the harmonisation and general rela@@ tivity theory of K@@ van@@ ia , the physical Gra@@ il of physi@@ cs has become the real Gra@@ il .
the people of scientists are working on this problem .
the most promising way seems to be a st@@ ring theory . &amp; quot ;
points of point
what does this theory tell us about the world ?
firstly , this partic@@ le is vie@@ wed not as a bun@@ ker , but if the elements that can be compared with the extremely small st@@ ring , which are a 10-@@ 35 metres , are the one that is in the middle of the 10@@ th , the first one is half of the cop@@ per .
these st@@ rings vibra@@ ting and the nature of their vibra@@ tions match the different types of the partic@@ les .
the more st@@ ring vibra@@ tes , the greater the power of the respective partic@@ les .
for one st@@ ring theory , which is necessary for this ma@@ te@@ tic integrity , super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
in order to understand what it is , a brief description of the basic partic@@ les &apos; z@@ o@@ ology is necessary .
K@@ van@@ t@@ ke@@ had in the universe can be divided into two families : there are fer@@ mi@@ ons where elec@@ trol@@ y@@ tes and var@@ n@@ ish@@ es are included on the other side of the b@@ os@@ on@@ ite family , which includes the fun@@ ction@@ ality of the fun@@ ction@@ ality of the EM@@ N and the gra@@ vit@@ on ( mention above ) .
Su@@ per@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try
su@@ per@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try is the pre@@ mise that each part of the family of fer@@ mi@@ on corresponds to a part of the b@@ os@@ on family and counter@@ side , so sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
the Su@@ per@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ tic part hasn &apos;t yet been dis@@ played , but physi@@ c@@ ists are hoping for them with a high energy col@@ lis@@ ion , which they are hoping for , using L@@ H@@ C , the new C@@ ER@@ N@@ N partic@@ le accele@@ ra@@ tor .
alterna@@ tively , as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers may indirectly monitor the effects of my@@ steri@@ ous partic@@ les , because the total mass of g@@ ala@@ xy and g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies appears to be much higher than the lumin@@ ous mass ( letters , ga@@ ys , etc . ) which are as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers .
they therefore pos@@ se@@ ss an in@@ visible pattern of mas@@ sage , which is a reci@@ pro@@ cal matter only through this gra@@ vity , and contains very stable , so also very small partic@@ les .
there are a number of key features that the most spi@@ ri@@ tual super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try share .
they may therefore be un@@ familiar with the composition of the mas@@ ses , the phenomenon which was initially investigated by the F@@ rit@@ z Z@@ w@@ ick@@ y Z@@ w@@ ick@@ y in 19@@ 33 .
four opposite interactions with one single interaction
the second question , which is proble@@ matic for scientists , concerns the four@@ -@@ month nature of nature .
why are their streng@@ ths so different from each other ?
for example , the strength of gra@@ vity reciproc@@ ity is much weak@@ er than the electro@@ magnetic interaction .
it is proof that the mag@@ net mag@@ net is enough to have a high level of me@@ tal@@ lic mass , while the gra@@ vity of the gra@@ vity is needed to move the same mass .
one question that this question is is that all the fundamental inter@@ faces are only one of the extremely high energy wholesale , which began to fall in the beginning of the Uni@@ verse .
business persis@@ tence is a very important business success .
and in the modern world , the functioning of each company is inter@@ ro@@ g@@ atory with interrup@@ tions .
some of the ris@@ es can inter@@ f@@ ere with your business for days , but in the competition environment , even a four@@ -@@ hour period may be fatal .
as a result of the increase in the number of ris@@ ky risks , the worst scenario of &amp; quot ; insurance policy &amp; quot ; has changed in business sustainability .
