the purpose of this report is to describe the steps to be taken to build a staff management function – to clarify the PH strategy and operations .
currently , the investment department is not a Ph@@ -@@ function .
the idea of this report was set out in the debate on the leader of the EU@@ PC@@ U leader D@@ ace Ro@@ z .
the contents of the PH@@ S plan were also discussed with other entities : An@@ ita Bis@@ of@@ a , Val@@ da Ce@@ pu@@ ri@@ ers and Val@@ dis Bis@@ ters .
Mo@@ e &apos;s investment department is growing rapidly and faces many changes in the coming years .
possible changes in the organisation &apos;s organisation are already in consideration .
the pressure to deal effectively and correctly with both working processes and staff matters is urgent .
in the current situation , directors and managers of entities are so busy with projects so that it is not simply time for the development of PH .
it is highly recommended to appoint a person responsible for the PH , which could focus on the establishment of the staff management system and would be able to further develop it in accordance with practical needs .
prior to the investment department PH , the vision and mission of the department must be clear .
the Investment Department strategy and the short-term action plan are recommended to review a yearly review .
the participation of the EU , but also in national programmes , should be highlighted in line with the real need .
the number of projects will increase significantly and more projects will reach the implementation phase , which affects the number of workers needed and their competences .
soon , the PR@@ K ( Hand@@ book on implementation of the project ) and P@@ K@@ J ( project organisation ) will soon be fin@@ alised .
they should be used in this au@@ tumn .
the PR@@ K shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the relevant sub-@@ processes .
these guidelines provide practical guidance on both work@@ flow and organisation .
these guidelines should serve as a basis for the following steps such as writing and identifying the fields of competence .
the measures necessary for the development and future practical development of the staff management system are described in Annex III .
the initial plan for the establishment of the PH@@ S system is set out in Annex IV .
the plan is a pre@@ requisite for the staff manager / coordin@@ ator to start full-@@ time work on a PH development in early December 2003 .
the Director of the Department and Heads of Unit should cooperate closely with the staff management staff , inform him of the needs of continuous development and to priorit@@ ise it .
they are also responsible for the evaluation of development and the sco@@ reboard ; staff management staff contribute to the modernisation and storage of temp@@ lates .
the Heads of Unit must also play an active role in developing areas of competence and content .
the self-@@ evaluation of competences involves all staff .
staff management staff shall coordinate the assessment of competences and manage data files .
the draft budget for the 2004 budget must include both the cost of PH development costs ( mainly the PH@@ S , the staff of the units , IT staff ) and the operational costs of training .
the cost of implementation consists of direct costs ( e__DOT__g__DOT__ courses , le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs , materials ) , time for teaching and training , training for training participants and training and facilitation of the training and facilitation of the PH@@ S staff .
once a year , due to lost working time , the cost and PL@@ P inter@@ views will also occur .
prior to the supply of any budget calculation , an indicative assessment of the 2004 training activities is required .
this Act regula@@ tes the energy industry as economic infrastructure , which includes the acquisition and use of energy resources and the production , purchase , transformation , recording , storage , distribution , storage , transfer , distribution and supply of energy for energy consumers , and the development of the organisation of trade in energy supply traders .
energy policy is part of the national economic policy and Latvia &apos;s national energy programme will need to define its implementation strategy , which will be developed for 15 years and needs to be improved regularly – on the basis of research and the economic change of the country , but also taking into account the national energy industry and energy supply factors .

in view of the call of the March 2005 Council meeting , Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for 2005-@@ 2008 ( the &amp; quot ; programme &amp; quot ; ) with a view to promoting the country &apos;s growth and employment .
the programme is a policy planning document which shows how the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy 2005-@@ 2008 will achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the years 2005-@@ 2008 following the integrated guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005 .
the programme reflects the main problems of Latvia in achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and demonstra@@ tes the main features of these challenges and activities , but also the performance indicators for achieving these objectives .
the programme is based on the policy planning documents approved by the Republic of Latvia .
the development of the programme helped to coordinate the Lisbon Strategy Council .
the consultation was held with the European Parliament and the social partners .
the programme consists of an introduction , a key part ( macroeconomic policy , micro@@ economic reforms , guidelines for employment policy ) and annexes .
all numer@@ ical information and figures were obtained from the statistical office of the Republic of Latvia or Eurostat , except in cases specifically indicated .
in order to achieve the successful achievement of these objectives , minis@@ tries will take into account the development of strategic plans in order to prepare the 2007 budget based on the principles of strategic planning , in line with the priorities set by the government , and , as well as all relevant minis@@ tries , programmes and sub-@@ programmes related to the specific minis@@ tries , including their funding .
to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area ,
adopted the Minis@@ terial Office on 21 July 2005 to establish a European single currency in Latvia with the task of the Commission to develop the necessary action plan to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area .
on 31 December 2004 , the public debt amoun@@ ted to DEM 9@@ 75 million , or 13@@ ,@@ 3 % of GDP .
public debt is expected to increase gradually in the coming years and may reach 13__DOT__@@ 6 % of GDP in 2008 .
Latvia &apos;s public debt is one of the smal@@ lest in the European Union , and it is expected that it will remain significantly below the country gross debt criterion ( 60 % of GDP ) , as defined in the Maas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty .
on the basis of the information provided , Latvia is not required to develop a specific plan to reduce sovereign debt , but before any measures in the area of public debt management have to be carefully analysed , possible risks should be analysed to ensure that the country is most favou@@ red .
the main proposed measures in the area of public debt 2005-@@ 2008 ( Guideline 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary resources to finance the deficit and re@@ financing public debt obligations at the lowest possible cost and as favourable conditions as possible , limiting financial risks and taking into account the development of the Lat@@ vian State capital market and all financial systems ( responsible authority : Ministry of Finance ) :
– to develop new debt re@@ financing programmes and debt exchange programmes to manage debt re@@ financing risks in order to use the opportunities offered by the capital market to attract long term resources ;
- The reduction already started by the State &apos;s external debt service is reviewed by all existing provisions of external loans to assess the future repayment of multiple loans – re@@ financing loans for other more favourable loans – or possible changes to the provisions of the loan agreement .
the sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed posi@@ tively and is characterised by relatively small public debt , but also adequate budgetary discipline .
Latvia &apos;s commitment to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact , as well as the achievement of the objective of accession to the euro area , is another additional guarantee of positive trends in the current budgetary position .
from the long-term perspective , the sustainability of public finances is mainly influen@@ ced by ageing populations , leading to a shrin@@ king population and their share of population and increasing demographic pressures .
the preliminary calculations of financial sustainability show that the ageing population is affected by the Lat@@ vian society and the economy and public finances of the country , but thanks to the pension reform introduced , it does not have any consequences .
Latvia ’ s small public debt and pressures on increasing costs give the government some flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances .
it must be noted , however , that the ageing population will try a health system in a new way .
the breakdown of health costs according to age groups clearly shows that higher costs will fall to older people whose number increases significantly over the next 50 years .
long-term care costs are currently relatively small in Latvia due to the limited resources of the government and local authorities , but also from the traditions and values of society .
at the same time , the health of other demographic groups must also be ensured as the overall incidence of mor@@ bid@@ ity is high .
the government will develop an effective health care system based on long-term perspe@@ ctives .
changes in national monetary policy are needed to adapt substantially to the current demographic situation .
since the demographic burden increases in the long term , the increase in living standards for all population groups will play a decisive role in increasing GDP based on increased productivity .
it is therefore important to ensure that the main wealth of Latvia is educ@@ ated in accordance with the labour market requirements , in order to create an accessible labour market ( see section 3 ) .
in the overall development of the Lat@@ vian State , the forest , as it meets the requirements of the wood processing , one of the raw materials of the largest export sector in Latvia .
the forest is also important in rural development , as it provides a live@@ lihood for residents working in different areas , 150 000 forest owners and forestry companies .
part of the revenue generated by the har@@ vest and har@@ vest or services shall be invested in the forest owner to maintain or maintain the value of the forest .
the largest forest owners ( country , local authorities and some private forestry companies to which thousands of hecta@@ res belong to forests ) can ensure a continuous production process throughout the long forest management cycle .
taking into account the composition , age , structure , previous administrative practice , economic situation of the rural region , but also forest owners ’ knowledge , the continuous forest production is significantly ham@@ pered by forest production .
in the light of the above , there is currently insufficient investment in the rest@@ oration of forest value in priva@@ tisation ( revenues ) ; it is therefore necessary to promote the productivity of wood ( timely and high-quality up@@ grading of forests , the use of forest reproductive material in forest renewal , the growing of young people ) , particularly in private bodies .
although Latvia &apos;s waste management systems have been complemen@@ ted and society &apos;s awareness of the need to reduce the production of gar@@ bage has increased , the amount of gar@@ bage generated is rising every year .
the possibility of processing and utilisation of waste is insufficient , although companies can obtain subsidies for the collection and disposal of waste from environmentally harmful goods from the Lat@@ vian environmental protection fund and products .
water management infrastructures ( water supply and waste water collection and handling ) are inadequ@@ ately developed and ob@@ s@@ olete , its capacity is not economically justified , the technologies used are co@@ stly and not to all environmental requirements .
it restric@@ ts the development of activity , especially in remote areas of the country .
access to water infrastructure is very much affected by the development of commun@@ u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties , social ca@@ tering , health and tourism industries .
Latvia must determine the time-@@ limit for transposition of internal market rules , but also to ensure monitoring of the implementation of the national management and political management directives .
as at 7 September 2005 , Latvia had not informed the EU of the transposition of EU directives ( or 0,5 % of the total number of directives ) .
having regard to the fact that 99@@ ,5 % of the Directives were trans@@ posed into Lat@@ vian regulations as at 7 September 2005 , it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective is met by at least 98@@ ,5 % of the directives or a deficit of 1__DOT__5 % of the directives .
transposition and implementation of internal market directives depend directly on establishing a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation .
as far as the current transposition of EU legislation is concerned , an effective database has not been established to monitor the transposition process within a number of reference points , and therefore – in addition to other circumstances – the transposition process is slow@@ ed down and the creation of the EU internal market framework is ham@@ pered .
the scar@@ ce staff of public administrations will reduce their capacity to ensure a qualitative and timely compliance with the EU &apos;s transposition process in the Lat@@ vian legal system .
the restrictions on the freedoms of the EU internal market were lost before Latvia &apos;s accession to the EU , but there are obstacles to cross-border transactions .
significant obstacles arise from existing licensing requirements and time-@@ consum@@ ing administrative operations requiring businesses to spend extra money and time and have the worst impact on small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and compliance of existing systems of licensing and other restrictions on EU requirements , including liber@@ al professions ( lawyers , no@@ taries , accoun@@ tants , archite@@ cts , engine@@ ers and pharma@@ c@@ ists ) in order to promote competitiveness in these sectors .
for the introduction of harmonised and harmonised competition rules , Lat@@ vian competition standards were harmonised in 2004 according to the requirements of EU competition standards .
in case of obstacles to competition , or prevention of potential distortions of competition , the Competition Office of Latvia launched an active cooperation between the European Commission and the NC@@ A Member States .
the electricity market is gradually opening .
as at 1 July 2004 , a qualified free consumer status threshold for legal persons was set at 0,@@ 0 G@@ W@@ h .
therefore , only households cannot be choo@@ sed to choose the supplier and the opening of the electricity market is guaranteed to 75 % .
until now , none of the free customers swit@@ ched the electricity supplier .
in order to stimulate competition and to encourage the entry of alternative suppliers , the functions of transfer@@ ring electricity and distribution are legally and fun@@ ction@@ ally separated from the functions of electricity generation and sale .
the conditions for electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law .
the EU will build our common future and take global commitments using only 1 % of its wealth .
in the focus of the aus@@ ter@@ ity decisions , it is for today &apos;s world to respond to the challenges posed by our societies in the interests of better lives of EU citizens .
the European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the EU , representing the 7@@ 36 members of the European Parliament representing you , the citizens of the 27 EU Member States will select them every five years on behalf of the Union &apos;s 500 million citizens .
this section of our website will find information on how Parliament operates its work through a system of various committees , and the work of the European Parliament is therefore important because decisions on new European laws are jointly made by the Parliament and the Council of Ministers .
Parliament has an active role in drawing up legislation affecting the daily lives of its citizens , such as environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods .
the European Parliament is composed of 7@@ 36 members elected in the 27 Member States of the enlarged European Union .
since 19@@ 79 , MEPs have been elected by direct universal suff@@ rage for five years .
each Member State shall decide on the form of elections to be held but must comply with the same democratic basic rules : gender equality and secret voting .
in all Member States , 18 years of electoral age are in place , except in Austria for 16 years .
the European elections are already governed by a number of common principles : direct and general elections , propor@@ tional representation and five-@@ year term of office .
as a general rule , places are distributed in proportion to the population of each Member State .
each Member State has a certain number of seats – most of 99 and least 5 .
equality between men and women : the role of women in the European Parliament is strongly increasing .
at present , women are women over a third of Parliament &apos;s members .
MEPs will share their time between Brussels , Strasbourg and their district in Brussels , in Brussels meetings and in plenary sessions , and in the plenary sessions in Strasbourg , they participate in 12 plenary sessions .
in parallel with the main activity , they must , of course , dedi@@ cate time to their district .
members of the European Parliament shall be group@@ ed by common political views , not by nationality .
they shall use their mandate independently .
since the power of Members of the European Parliament is increasing , they have an impact on all the areas of citizens &apos; daily lives : the environment , consumer protection , transport and education , culture , health , etc .
the new Statute of Members of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 __DOT__ the new Statute has been amended to become more transparent and provides the same EU budget for all members .
in the European Parliament , all Community languages are equally important : all Parliament documents are published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) and every member of the European Parliament has the right to speak in the official language of their choice .
what better way to ensure transparency and accessibility for Parliament &apos;s work ?
multilingu@@ alism in European agreements firmly reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes the European institutions more accessible to the public and more transparent , helping to ensure the success of the EU &apos;s democratic system .
the European Parliament distingu@@ ish@@ es from other EU institutions its responsibility to ensure multilingu@@ alism to the greatest possible extent .
all EU citizens must be able to access them directly in their own language .
and since every European citizen has the right to stand in elections to the European Parliament , it is un@@ reasonable to require members of a common language to have a common language .
the right of each member to read Parliament &apos;s documents in his language shall be followed , followed by the word expressly laid down in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure .
in addition , the European Parliament , as legisla@@ tor , must ensure that all acceptable legislative acts are good in all official languages .
furthermore , the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament &apos;s work , ask questions and receive answers in their language .
the European Parliament , in its resolution on 9 October , that &amp; quot ; experience gained from previous European elections and referendu@@ ms shows that most people who are aware of the EU issues and interested parties are less likely to participate and less likely to participate &amp; quot ; .
on the eve of the European Parliament elections in October 2009 , the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration on Communic@@ ating Europe in Partnership with a view to highlighting the necessary political pre@@ paredness for all EU institutions and Member States for the EU &apos;s information work on the European Union .
the main objective of the joint declaration is to give citizens fair and diverse information on the EU , so that they can actively speak in the public debate on the European Union .
the EU , in cooperation with the Member States , took the joint declaration to address problems of Commun@@ ity-@@ wide Commun@@ ity-@@ wide communication with the Member States in order to ensure the highest possible level of communication at the right level .
in this context , they expressed their desire to develop synergies with national , regional and local authorities and representatives of civil society .
although each Member State and each institution have its communication strategy and its priorities , Parliament , the Council and the Commission agreed on a small number of common communication priorities for each year .
in addition , the Commission is invited to provide feed@@ back to other EU institutions at the beginning of each year on the main achievements of the implementation of the common communication priorities for the previous year .
the European Union was created to end the frequent ver@@ bal w@@ ars of the neighbours , which became the Second World War .

in the 19@@ 50@@ s , there is a cold war between east and west .
in Hungary , the prote@@ sts against Commun@@ ist regimes will be pus@@ hed down in 19@@ 56 by the So@@ vi@@ et regime ; the So@@ vi@@ et Union will take the leader of the So@@ vi@@ et Union in the run@@ -up to the space race when it s@@ ends the first tea@@ m@@ mate S@@ pu@@ tn@@ ik@@ -1 .
in 19@@ 57 , the Treaty of Rome establishes a European Economic Community ( EEC ) or a ‘ single market ’ .
in the 19@@ 60@@ s , the &amp; quot ; youth culture &amp; quot ; , the Be@@ at@@ les and other an@@ sa@@ mb@@ les will attract huge teen@@ ag@@ ers , encouraging the expansion of cultural re@@ volution and the expansion between generations .
the economy is good times , partly because the EU countries end up collecting customs duties in trade .
in addition , they shall establish a common control of food production , resulting in sufficient food and a surplus of agricultural products .
in May 19@@ 68 , there are famous students in Paris and &amp; quot ; 6@@ 68 generations &amp; quot ; will be associated with many changes in society and human behaviour .
on 1 January 19@@ 73 , the number of members of the European Union is rising to nine if Ireland , Denmark and the United Kingdom are joining .
a short , however , violent war in Ara@@ bia in October 19@@ 73 brings Europe &apos;s energy crisis and economic challenges .
the last right@@ -@@ hand dic@@ ta@@ tor@@ ships in Europe are falling , in 19@@ 74 , the Sala@@ z@@ ar regime in Portugal , and in 1975 , General Fran@@ co dies in Spain .
the EU ’ s regional policy is set up to allocate sums to create jobs and develop infrastructure in po@@ ore@@ r regions .
the impact of the European Parliament on the EU &apos;s business is increasing , and in 19@@ 79 citizens will be able to choose directly from Parliament .
in Europe and in the world , the Polish trade union , Soli@@ dar@@ no@@ ś@@ ć , and its leader L@@ ech Wal@@ es@@ a , when the attacks on ship@@ buil@@ ders in the summer of 1980 in the summer of 1980 in G@@ d@@ ans@@ k .
in 19@@ 81 , the EU will become members of Greece and five years later , Spain and Portugal will join .
in 1987 , a Single European Act will be signed .
this agreement provides the basis for a comprehensive six-@@ year programme aimed at addressing the EU &apos;s cross-border free trade problems and thus shap@@ ing the common market .
the political shock will lead to the destruction of the Berlin W@@ all on 9 November 1989 and the re-@@ opening of the border between East and West Germany after 28 years of time .
the col@@ lapse of Commun@@ ism throughout Central and Eastern Europe will strengthen the neighbourhood relations of Europeans .
in 1993 , the creation of a common market for the &amp; quot ; four fundamental freedoms &amp; quot ; is the free movement of goods , services , people and money .
two new agreements are also signed in the 199@@ 0s : the Treaty of Maas@@ tri@@ cht in 1993 , or the Maas@@ tri@@ cht Treaty , in 1999 .
citizens are increasingly concerned about the protection of the environment , while looking for new opportunities for European security and defence activities .
in 1995 , the EU will receive three new members , Austria , Finland and Sweden .
the Schengen Agreements which have received the name of the Luxembourg small town will be a gradual opportunity for people to travel without offering a passport to the national borders .
millions of young people go to EU support in other countries .
communication will become easier and more people are able to use mobile phones and Internet .
the new monetary currency of many Europeans can be the euro .
the political gap between the Eastern and Western Europe will be defini@@ tively proc@@ lai@@ med in 2004 , with no fewer or more than 10 new countries .
many people believe that Europe now has a time for its constitution , but it is far from easy to agree on what it should be and debate on the future of Europe .
the euro will allow the euro to compare prices directly in all Member States that use it .
trans@@ -@@ national travel is simp@@ ler because the cost of money is no longer the cost of money .
competition with the common market has helped increase quality and lower prices .
phone calls , Internet connection , and air@@ borne .
the EU will protect consumers from defec@@ tive and un@@ quality products regardless of whether goods are purchased from home or from another country .
the EU also sets the highest standards of food safety .
EU citizens can live , work or reti@@ re in other EU countries .
temporary restrictions are gradually abol@@ ished on the free movement of workers from 12 new@@ est Member States .
over two million young people have been stu@@ dying or training in the EU &apos;s programmes in another European country .
thanks to this , every student and other lear@@ ner , which is Erasmus , Leon@@ ardo and other cross-border partnerships , will know .
the EU does not decide what school learning is lear@@ nt but seeks to ensure that the education and professional qualifications acquired in other EU countries are recognised without problems .
good health is an important issue for Europeans and their governments .
the EU is therefore at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of the efforts to protect and combat the global environment .
since pollution does not feel boun@@ d@@ aries , the EU has been jointly acting in this area for years .
it is not surpris@@ ing that European ri@@ vers and be@@ aches are clean@@ er , cars pollu@@ te less and strict rules on waste management .
European hazardous waste can no longer be transported to poor countries .
strict EU rules also apply to the safety of chemicals used by companies and the environment .
the EU aims to make transport , industry , agriculture and tourism work so that they do not destroy natural resources – in other words , that development is sustainable .
in order to stop climate change , the EU has agreed on strict measures to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 % by 2020 .
energy is the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the EU &apos;s long-term climate policy and the EU has set binding targets for wind , hydro@@ -@@ and solar energy and other clean renewable energy sources .
in addition to combating climate change , it contributes to the economy and to secure more stable energy supplies by reducing Europe &apos;s dependence on foreign oil and gas imports .
the EU has already introduced an innovative emission trading scheme , thanks to which many energy-@@ consum@@ ing companies can benefit from reducing energy consumption and are pun@@ is@@ ha@@ ble by companies crossing the borders .
euro ( € ) is probably one of the most tangible achievements of the EU .
the single currency is in use in 16 countries in which over two thirds of the EU population lives .
other countries will join when their economies are ready .
all Euro@@ s and euro coins can be used in all countries where the euro is turnover .
paper money is the same everywhere , but there is a common design and a sign of the country of origin on the other side .
the euro is turnover in the following countries : Austria , Belgium , Spain , the Netherlands , Ireland , Italy , Greece , Cyprus , Luxembourg , Malta , Portugal , France , Germany , Slovakia , Slovenia and the United Kingdom .
our society is fa@@ irer and more efficient if we do not discrimin@@ ate against other people because of their nationality , gender , disability , race or other speci@@ alities .
the EU therefore prohi@@ bits discrimination .
in the 19@@ 50@@ s , the first EU treaties included a clear rule , men and women must receive equal pay for equal work .
it was a pi@@ one@@ er in the fight against women &apos;s rights , and today they form an integral part of EU policies .
in order to fight cross-border crime and terrorism , EU countries have taken steps to ensure the comprehensive cooperation between police and customs officials , migration authorities and courts .
one practical measure is the European Ar@@ rest War@@ rant , which will facilitate the transfer of suspected persons from the country where they are arrested , the country where they seek to investigate and judge them .
EU countries also coordinate asylum policy and strengthen the EU &apos;s external borders .
as EU citizens are entitled to live in all Member States , their rights must also be protected in all EU countries .
the governments of the Member States must ensure the uniform application of EU legislation and the enfor@@ ceability of each national court in other Member States .
the EU has greatly facilita@@ ted cross-border legal , such as marriage , separation , divorce and custody of children and other civil disputes .
new skills are needed and we need to spend more time on learning to learn .
more information on EU employment and growth .
the war between EU countries is un@@ thin@@ kable today , thanks to the un@@ ity between countries in the last 50 years .
in view of this success , the EU now aims to promote peace and stability outside its borders .

he wasn &apos;t the only son of his father , even though his brother was ol@@ dest ; his brother William made his business in Cu@@ c@@ ko@@ ld &apos;s pool and the sho@@ res of Av@@ on St__DOT__ Phili@@ p , and he had three sis@@ ters on the shore , and he had three sis@@ ters .
M@@ organs ’ s nes@@ ts were found in a number of places , but the Rus@@ si@@ ans of the Ric@@ har@@ t cla@@ n - who were believed to have travel@@ led in Wal@@ es in times of time - had been living in a certain position to achieve a certain position in the municipal@@ ity of the municipal@@ ity .
Richard &apos;s father wasn &apos;t one of them , but he didn &apos;t have a reason to embarras@@ s .
after a short study in primary school , he went to work as a house@@ house , and later , a free man , a free man who paid his fines , tried to stay in the de@@ sert owner .
he also arran@@ ged a socially suitable marriage ; Marga@@ ret B@@ ig@@ gs was from B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster &apos;s sources of we@@ al@@ thy pe@@ asant pe@@ asant , and , among other things , to write the reading skills , even though he did not understand .
children , the first of these girl , came to the weather with sufficient frequency , so that one of them would suffer un@@ be@@ ar@@ able pain and gri@@ ef .
when Dick learned to rule out so much before the e@@ jac@@ ula@@ ting , the number of children survi@@ ved with two living sons and three girls .
quite a family , and enough small enough to take care of it .
dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read and write , and his hopes focused on Richard when it became clear that two years younger than that .
so , if Richard was seven years old , he was cha@@ sed by Col@@ ston Sch@@ ool Sch@@ ool Sch@@ ool and got a famous blue coat that declared b@@ ris@@ tol@@ ans that his father was poor but hon@@ or@@ able .
and in the next five years , he was filled with litera@@ cy and numer@@ acy .
he learned to write a nice hand , to calculate , che@@ w himself through Caesar &apos;s G@@ alli@@ a w@@ ars , C@@ ic@@ ero &apos;s calls and O@@ vi@@ di@@ us Me@@ ta@@ mor@@ pho@@ ses , and the words of the hel@@ ple@@ ss .
since he was a good student , even though the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws are far away , and the pe@@ tty art of poli@@ te restra@@ int , he escap@@ ed from the char@@ ity of Mr__DOT__ Col@@ ston &apos;s char@@ ity , and a greater benefit than many others .
at the age of 12 , it was time to leave school and to find a business or a professional profession in the education level .
as a surprise to the rela@@ tives , he didn &apos;t choose any of the M@@ organs &apos;s existing activities .
his greatest for@@ gi@@ veness proved to be a mechan@@ ic , a piece of things , and it was an admi@@ rable pati@@ ence for a young man .
and on my own choice , he became a student of Master To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , who held a weapon of weapons .
the father felt the silent jo@@ y of the decision , he had a remin@@ der that one of Morgan@@ s grew a cra@@ f@@ ts@@ man , not a trader .
besides , the war was part of life , and the war needed guns .
the man who made the weapons and repa@@ ired it didn &apos;t threa@@ ten the threat to the bat@@ tle@@ field .
for Ric@@ har@@ di , seven years of app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps were happy for work and learning , even though it was a little mo@@ dest for physical ple@@ asu@@ res .
as the other students , he worked for hire , living in the family &apos;s house , served him at the dinner table , filled the stomach with food residues and slept on the floor .
fortuna@@ tely , Lord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was a good master and even better a gun .
although he managed to prepare beautiful du@@ el guns and sh@@ ot@@ guns , he had enough to understand that they had to be in Man@@ ton , but Man@@ ton couldn &apos;t be outside of London .
so it was his job , the 4@@ 6-@@ in@@ ch dec@@ or@@ ations called &quot; B@@ essi@@ x B@@ essi@@ x __DOT__ &quot;
at the age of n@@ ine@@ teen , Richard received a mas@@ ter@@ piece and moved out of H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s &apos;s household , but not his work@@ shop .
that &apos;s where he continued to work on P@@ ru@@ un@@ ide B@@ es@@ side .
and she married , as a woman who had a grand@@ app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hip had changed .
spo@@ uses became his mother &apos;s brother , maybe a muscle ne@@ phe@@ w , but that the English Ch@@ urch had no objection to it , his bri@@ de at St__DOT__ James &apos;s church in the al@@ tar of his church .
the marriage was arran@@ ged , but there was a love of love between the spo@@ uses in the years .
although there were some confusion about the son of Richard Morgan and Marga@@ ret Bri@@ g@@ gs , Richard Morgan , he was married to Marga@@ ret Bri@@ g@@ gs .
until the H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s arms shop fully worked , there was nothing strange about the fact that the young couple lived in the Temp@@ le St@@ ree@@ t of Temp@@ le Street , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , and a Je@@ wish sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue .
marriage was concluded in 17@@ 67 , three years after the end of the se@@ ven@@ -@@ year war with France in the un@@ popular peace agreement , in spite of the difficulties in the debt of England to raise taxes , and the ne@@ sw@@ ering army and the fleet shar@@ ply tigh@@ ten up .
the weapons were no longer required , so they left the champi@@ ons and the students at H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s , until the entire company was in Ric@@ har@@ ds and Lord To@@ mas H@@ ab@@ ita@@ n himself .
and then , for a while after a little Mary was born in 17@@ 70 , H@@ ab@@ ita@@ s was re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant to have Richard &apos;s pri@@ de .
&quot; come to work , &quot; Dick Morgan was kind@@ ly invited .
&amp; quot ; The rail@@ ways are coming and go , but the rum remains __DOT__ &amp; quot ;
and that &apos;s what happened , despite the problem .
Richard &apos;s mother was always invited brief@@ ly to Ma@@ g and Richard &apos;s wife Pe@@ g , both of Marga@@ ret .
however , the problem was that all men in England - if the de@@ sc@@ end@@ ants of the ri@@ gid left prote@@ st@@ ors , who were cro@@ ssed into C@@ ran@@ field and O@@ ne@@ si@@ ph@@ or@@ us@@ - - were either the name of John , Mr Willia@@ ms , Mr Elizabeth , the Ja@@ mes@@ s or Mr Thomas .

the study is not based on solid qualitative data , forecasts or personal opinions , but have been assemb@@ led from many sources , including inter@@ views , ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , trends and evaluations .
all data before 1990 are based on inter@@ views and online sear@@ ches on numerous news@@ papers , television and radio , more specifically in search of information collection methods used earlier .
the schedule for the period after 1998 is based on everything that has happened over the last 11 years , which I have read about around 1000 different studies .
the 2009 and the next years will be based on forecasts from me and other people for the years ahead .
the gra@@ ph@@ s do not claim a hundred percent prec@@ ision , their purpose is to give an overview of changes in the situation and out@@ line social media news , targeted communication and other such future .
the article aims to make people think .
we are currently seeing a whole new way of how people can communicate - what makes traditional ways of simple ways .
this is a fundamental change that makes the world , which we feel , completely .
the best thing about this is that you can help get it done .
come with me to the last 2@@ 10-@@ year-old in the information source , plus a gli@@ mp@@ se of the next ten years .
before we start expl@@ oring the future , we &apos;ll see how we arrived today , so we go back to 18@@ 00 where finding the information was completely different .
in the 18@@ 00@@ s , people came out to communicate and meet them .
everything was fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face .
for the sale of a product , you should have gone to the local market and the only possibility to communicate with the local market , to meet a personal or set table .
it meant that it was in the right place to obtain information or to give it to it in time .
you didn &apos;t know what was going on in some other town , and couldn &apos;t sell your products to people in another place .
they were told about a novel concept called a news@@ paper __DOT____DOT__.
by 19@@ 00 , the news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines have changed their communication , enabling us to get the news where we were never .
we got our ideas to the people we never saw , and sell our products to others who were far away .
we had to go out and talk to other people , but we got to be aware of our town without leaving our city .
it was un@@ believable , the first real re@@ volution .
the world began to open everyone .
since 19@@ 20 , a new source of information for people &apos;s attention - radio .
suddenly , listen to another person &apos;s voice from hundreds of miles away .
but most import@@ antly , the latest information was possible to get in real time .
it was the next huge development in history .
however , the radio development period meant that , until 19@@ 60 , our lives were domin@@ ated by the news@@ papers .
if you wanted to get the latest news or introduce your product to people , you &apos;d have used the paper .
it seems that these are the most extensive source of information .
this situation began to change in 19@@ 60 .
the radio came after and two main sources of information were transmitted in real time from the radio and more detailed news transmitted through news@@ papers and maga@@ z@@ ines .
it was a great time for the media , although some said that &amp; quot ; for the news@@ papers to compete with the radio , better news@@ papers should be made &amp; quot ; - an argument that we could hear repeatedly about the next 50 years .
in the next 40 years , the next technology re@@ volution was introduced .
it started to collect public interest in the &apos; 19@@ 50@@ s and the early 199@@ 0s was a big , sou@@ th@@ west , big news@@ paper and maga@@ z@@ ines , but still domin@@ ated by radio .
now people get information as well as watching .
years ago , it was also time for the publish@@ ers of news@@ papers to understand that something is terri@@ bly wrong with their sales market .
they had a lot of trouble on radio competition , but television was another class .
only eight years later , and television was ruled by the information world , the radio was almost only &amp; quot ; place where to listen to free music &amp; quot ; and news@@ papers did everything that could be done .
the continuous development of technology continued with the persis@@ tence of which was never seen .
a new phenomenon in the sha@@ dows : Internet .
1998 was the year when the Internet became a strange place , which was not much important , un@@ question@@ ably , by bringing the attitude to that every company must have a website .
the re@@ volution has started three years earlier , but in 1998 it reached a critical mass and tried to pay attention , despite the fact that it was used relatively little and most people had no access .
however , everyone agreed that it was the future - the beginning of a new era .
it was a place where everyone could have received information from everywhere - at least in theory .
people started to understand that the Internet was more than just information .
when you joined the conversation , you could give something back and be part of it instead of being a wat@@ cher .
however , the most important thing was to choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it .
the Internet &apos;s opportunities were hi@@ de@@ ous .
in 2004 , only six years later , the Internet had changed how we were content .
however , television and news@@ papers domin@@ ated our news sources , but the latest world was definitely on the Internet .
people made new websites and discovered online applications .
people were able to do so much and participate in many areas so as to emer@@ ge from the new concept : the over@@ load of information .
for the first time in my life we were in contact with more information than we were able to absor@@ b .
in the age of news@@ papers , we had to choose what we wanted to see .
in 2004 , we had to choose what we did not want to see .
it had a de@@ vasta@@ ting effect on the traditional image of information .
in the past , it was possible to get people &apos;s attention in doing something .
people wanted more choices , so they just came to give them a new choice .
in 2004 , this changed because something different was not enough : it had to be better .
2004 was also a year when another phenomenon started to emer@@ ge : communication networks .
this concept was qui@@ et@@ ly collected by a flat blo@@ g .
it was easy for everyone , easy and accessible to share their ideas .
for the first time , everyone had a chance to create their own information , without any technical work .
the handling of information became a tool of professional tools for all tools .
three years later , and the social element of the Internet showed how powerful people really are .
for the first time , television was no longer a source of information , and news@@ papers fought for survival .
everyone wanted to create his little world and connect it to his friends .
2007 was also a break@@ point for traditional websites that were compared with the news@@ papers in the news@@ papers - static and pas@@ sive information .
we wanted an active information .
we wanted to be part of this , not just watching it .
blo@@ gs started getting into trouble .
as television was eliminated by the radio ( as it was better and more ri@@ cher to provide people with information ) , the social networks blo@@ cked the social networks .
the social profile is more active for people to share what they care about .
social networks are simply better and blo@@ gs are not able to stay behind .
two years later , today , the new Internet will domin@@ ate our world completely .
news@@ papers are dead in the water and people are watching less television than ever .
we are new k@@ ings , using the tools of social networks to contact and communicate .
even the traditional website dies , which has been killed by the constant force of the constant flow of information from social networks .
over the last 210 years we have seen an amazing development , how we can obtain information .
the main steps are :
1 __DOT__ information from remote places .
2 __DOT__ getting it in real time .
3 __DOT__ seeing it in real time .
4 __DOT__ deciding when to look at something and watch .
5 __DOT__ possibility to take part and comment .

2009 is the beginning of the next re@@ volution .
all we know is changing .
the first and most dra@@ matic change is the concept of social news .
it will quickly take over our need to know what is happening in the world .
the news will no longer be transmitted by journalists because now it has to be all .
they will be sent to you directly from the source , ski@@ pping traditional media .
instead of the journal@@ ist broadcasting what analy@@ sts say , you can hear it from the analy@@ st .
social news gets the news from the source straight and un@@ cen@@ so@@ red .
a new wave of enter@@ tainment is emerging ( bright blue and pur@@ ple areas ) domin@@ ating games , video and sound flows .
instead of putting on a TV channel , you decide what you want to look at and when you want to look at it .
we will no longer join the channels where anyone else decides what we can look at .
you control the entire experience .
in the form of a targeted information , a new concept is slowly emerging .
we already see a growing number of mobile telep@@ hon@@ y services that provide local information about this region where you are .
for example , instead of showing all the restaur@@ ants in the world , the phone will only show the list in your area .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s growing up in the coming years .
in the world where we have access to more information than we can consu@@ me , the relevant information is a very important element , extending much further to the simple location that we see today .
in the next five or ten years the information world will change .
all traditional forms die eventually .
printed news@@ papers no longer exist , television in the form of current channels is replaced by individual consig@@ nments that can be looked at if you want .
radio programmes are intended to replace voice vo@@ ices and video broadcas@@ ts .
websites have a much smaller role - their primary function is the distribution of activities that can be done elsewhere , becoming a place where people can use raw materials in other places .
many websites and networks will join one .
social news , as described previously , will become the dominant way of communic@@ ating people .
traditional journal@@ ism will be fully replaced by people who get information directly from the source .
everyone is a potential repor@@ ter , but new advantages for the use of target groups will remove most of the noise .
journalists will become ed@@ itors , instead of broad@@ ening the news , giving us a bigger picture .
the future of the future is person@@ alised , and it will constantly change according to what you look at , much in the same way that L@@ ast@@ __DOT__@@ f@@ m does with music today .
everything contains a target group .
you have control of every single inf@@ es@@ tation that moves towards you .
two new concepts will emer@@ ge in 2010 .
one of them is intelligent information where information flows can be included in several different news sources , not just pulling data , but taking it together , sharing it and issuing valuable parts .
instead of a five different reading in the same way , you will be given one , highlighting important points of interest .
how secure are your Christmas lights ?
EU tests show serious risks to the electric shock and fire integrity .
stay safe __DOT__ turn them off when you go to bed or get out of the house .
the market investigation carried out by the Commission pointed out that each set of Christmas lights had a direct risk of fire safety or shock .
the tests were carried out in Germany , Hungary , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia with a total of 200 sheep sets of all price categories .
the samples were checked over 20 claims and many failed in more than one test .
the Commission found a large number of sheep ’ s w@@ iring , weak lead and poor insu@@ lation .
only over 40 % of the samples were made in China .
in Hungary , almost 96 % of the lamps were found to be dangerous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % did not respond to EU security standards .
although only five countries took part in the survey , it is likely that the same lamps are sold across the EU .
the Commissioner for Consumer Protection Mag@@ len@@ a K@@ une@@ va said that the results were a@@ wake .
he ur@@ ged EU Member States to work better on security requirements and said that industry ( producers , retai@@ lers , retai@@ lers and importers ) should also make control more effective .
in the case of customers , he stressed vigilance by providing the following advice : 1 .
in Stockholm , some 4 000 participants are expected to take part in the Stockholm event , with the presentation of EU efforts to make development more effective .
the general theme &amp; quot ; citizens and development &amp; quot ; will focus on the impact of this year on the effects of global warming and the economic down@@ turn of po@@ ore@@ r countries .
although they are usually the last ones to blame , especially those countries are affected by the economic decline and climate change .
increased levels of sea level , de@@ serti@@ fication and increased frequency and more serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and un@@ prec@@ eden@@ ted development goals .
and the current economic climate has led to a reduction in assisting don@@ ations for developing countries , reducing food guarantees in already vulnerable areas .
bringing together politicians , public officials , NGOs , business leaders , acade@@ mics , acade@@ mics and media , the European Development Da@@ ys offer the opportunity to establish relations , sharing experiences and developing new partners for development projects .
the three days of the event , which begins on 22 October , includes training , discussion for@@ ums and work@@ shops .
&amp; quot ; Development village &amp; quot ; offers organisations the opportunity to introduce themselves to dele@@ gates and to the public and raise awareness of their objectives .
a number of a@@ wards will be distributed , including Lor@@ enzo Na@@ ta@@ li &apos;s journal@@ ism prize for human rights , democracy and development challenges .
youth development bon@@ us goes for teen@@ ag@@ ers or vide@@ os showing human development in Africa .
the EU will also make public the first European progress report on the day .
this represents the dispatch of dispatch to the EU approach to sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa countries .
the EU provides more than half of all development aid .
the donors conference s@@ ends strong signals to Georgia .
until later , Georgia was the fas@@ test growing economy in the world , 12 % in 2007 .
this changed in August , but in the course of the ten@@ se conflict with Russia .
key transport lines and u@@ ti@@ li@@ ties were damaged , buildings and houses became a stone bu@@ b@@ ble and bom@@ bs destroyed large forest areas .
more than two months later , many foreign investors have left , tour@@ ists have gone , unemployment has ris@@ en and many ge@@ or@@ gies have dra@@ ined their bank accounts .
the World Bank now predi@@ cts that Georgia , the energy source of energy in Europe needs EUR 2__DOT__4 billion to recover .
over the next three years , the EU has allocated EUR 500 million and the US has promised EUR 7@@ 57 million ( 1 billion dollars ) over half of this year .
the EU and the World Bank were ho@@ sting donors &apos; conference on 22 October to meet the remaining € 1__DOT__1 billion .
nearly 70 countries and the institution were invited to the event .
the aid supports reconstruction and helps the Georgi@@ an Government to meet the first needs of those people who had to escape their homes .
tens of thousands of people were re@@ settled , many of them still find shel@@ ter in temporary refugee centres .
but the lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term goal is to restore Georgia &apos;s economy , which has made great changes in recent years .
&amp; quot ; It is important that the crisis does not lead Georgia away from making political and economic reforms , which is now more important than before the conflict &amp; quot ; said Commissioner Ben@@ ita Ferre@@ ro-@@ Wald@@ ner .
the former So@@ vi@@ et Republic is usually about EUR 40 million per year from the European Union .
between Georgia and Russia , there are differences between South Os@@ se@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ haz@@ ia - two separate Georgi@@ an provin@@ ce , which Russia recognises as independent countries .
two sides have the first peace talks in Geneva on 15 October and talks will continue under the aus@@ pic@@ es of the UN and European intermediaries in November .
this allowed EU observers to move to the ce@@ ase@@ fire monitoring areas .
thousands of Russian soldiers have left the separ@@ at@@ ists .
European mus@@ ici@@ ans were awarded for a well-@@ selling de@@ bu@@ tion .
ten new stars share the light of the European B@@ order B@@ rea@@ kers A@@ wards at the event .
recognising the success of the wider audi@@ ence , European A@@ wards are pri@@ zes for mus@@ ici@@ ans whose de@@ de@@ sc@@ ent is well sold in the European Union ( except their home country ) .
the win@@ ners of this year are the hot@@ test names of the European music landscap@@ e - A@@ dele ( British ) , Al@@ pha@@ beat ( Denmark ) , Aaron ( France ) , C@@ ine@@ ma Bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re ( Germany ) , The D@@ ø Cor@@ r ( Netherlands ) , The S@@ cri@@ pt ( Denmark ) and The T@@ ing Cor@@ r ( Netherlands ) ,
the pri@@ zes will be handed over to the Euro@@ son@@ ic No@@ order@@ sla@@ g opening in the Dutch city of G@@ ron@@ ing@@ en , which is also transferred on television .
the event that includes presen@@ tations of current and previous win@@ ners is the British TV character Jo@@ ols Holland .
now , in its sixth year , the prize is an international success and support for the European music industry , which offers work about 600 000 people .
the former win@@ ners are now known ar@@ tists like Car@@ la Br@@ uni , To@@ ki@@ o Ho@@ tel , Da@@ mi@@ en R@@ ice , The Fra@@ tel@@ lis and Gabriel Ri@@ os , who lives in Belgium .
he is present at the cere@@ mony of this year , recorded and transferred in real time via the EB@@ U T@@ V@@ and radio network on Saturday , 17 January , beginning at 20 : 15 ( C@@ ET ) .
one of the last year win@@ ners was Finland &apos;s rock band Sun@@ rise Avenue , which became victory for his &quot; The Wa@@ y to W@@ on@@ der@@ land &quot; albu@@ m .
Mik@@ ko Sau@@ k@@ kon@@ en , the band Bon@@ nier A@@ mig@@ o &apos;s campaign campaign , said that the prize is a group that is recording the second albu@@ m now .
&quot; we are very sure that this will help the band in future __DOT__ &amp; quot ;
the 2008 C@@ annes f@@ esti@@ val shows the success of the EU films in the world .
four@@ teen film , which has partly supported the EU Me@@ dia Programme , has been selected by 61 C@@ annes International film f@@ esti@@ val .
film f@@ esti@@ vals are no longer a stran@@ ger to EU funding and have seen millions of people over the years .
the EU media programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of the continent through the film .
however , European film makers are facing major challenges both internationally and at home .
in 19@@ th May , in the sixth ‘ Europe Day ’ , EU representatives will sit together with European film ministers and producers to discuss how to encourage the audiovisual industry to increase international cooperation .
the aim is to bro@@ a@@ den the circulation of content into other parts of the world and cooperate more closely with other EU film industries .
such an international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films .
the choice of C@@ annes F@@ esti@@ val last year included some film financed by the EU Me@@ dia Programme .
and at the beginning of this year , many films ( e__DOT__g__DOT__ The counterfe@@ i@@ ters and La M@@ ô@@ me ) were presented to O@@ sc@@ ari@@ ans .
four@@ teen EU-@@ funded film C@@ annes f@@ esti@@ vals were : G@@ om@@ or@@ , Del@@ ta , La fron@@ ti@@ ère de l &apos;@@ au@@ be de Lor@@ na , The Pal@@ er@@ mo S@@ hoo@@ ting , san@@ gue pa@@ zzo , san@@ gue pa@@ zzo , En@@ tre les .
at the EU-@@ China Summit in Pra@@ gue on 20 May , climate change , financial crisis and economic relations were domin@@ ated .
the EU and China signed agreements to expand cooperation on science and technology , clean energy and small business .
they reaffir@@ med their commitment to the project in order to develop technology to produce electricity from coal without iso@@ lating carbon dioxide , one of the main causes of global warming .
two sides discussed the views of the international climate change debate in Copenhagen in December .
the EU recommends developing economies , such as China , to restrict carbon emissions by providing financial support from developed countries .
in the financial crisis , the EU and China agreed that international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic risks and emerging and emerging economies should have more say in these institutions .
at the peak of the peak in May in May , two sides highlighted trade and investment as key economic recovery .
the two sides discussed the human rights situation in Ti@@ bet and conflicts in Sri Lanka , Afghanistan and Pakistan - three countries in which China has significant influence .
on Tuesday 15 December , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis sent a letter to the Estonian Prime Minister Andr@@ us An@@ si@@ le , expres@@ sing con@@ dol@@ ences to the Estonian people and the Prime Minister in Afghanistan in Afghanistan .
in my letter of sy@@ mpa@@ thy , Prime Minister stressed that the death of a soldier is a great loss to the victim &apos;s family and to Estonia .
Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis and Minister of Agriculture , J@@ ā@@ n D@@ Ū@@ K@@ LA@@ V@@ S , who held the meeting of the Estonian Minister for Agriculture , Mr Se@@ ed@@ er , the Minister for Agriculture of the Agriculture Minister , Kaz@@ y ST@@ AR@@ K@@ EV@@ I@@ Č@@ I@@ US and the Agriculture and Food Ministers of the Agriculture and Food Ministers of Belarus .
the Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture , J@@ ā@@ nis D@@ Ū@@ K@@ LA@@ V@@ S , announced the Memor@@ andu@@ m of Under@@ standing , signed today and which creates better conditions for cooperation between these countries in agriculture .
it is based on equality and mutual benefit by harmon@@ ising legislation and ex@@ changing information and carrying out practical projects .
the Prime Minister stressed : &amp; quot ; Memor@@ andu@@ m , which was signed today , promotes cooperation with all four countries in a very important occupation - agriculture &amp; quot ; .
the Minister for Agriculture and Food , Se@@ my@@ on S@@ hap@@ iro , Belarus than@@ ked Mr J@@ ā@@ n D@@ ū@@ kla@@ v@@ si for the initiative of the Lat@@ vian Minister for Agriculture , which came out on his visit to Min@@ sk to bring together three Baltic States and the current events in the field , but also to set certain tasks in the future .
the Minister for Agriculture and Food in Belarus noted that Belarus had extensive practical experience in the production of agricultural machinery and that the country would be interested in creating joint ven@@ tures with Latvia .
Minister S@@ hap@@ iro called for the professional farmers of Latvia and other Baltic States to provide practical experience in the certification of enterprises producing agricultural products and agricultural machinery in order to ensure the sale of Belar@@ usi@@ an agricultural products on the EU market .
the Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture Kaz@@ ys ST@@ AR@@ K@@ EV@@ I@@ Č@@ I@@ US expressed his gra@@ titude in Brussels for active cooperation in agriculture and fisheries in the European Union , Finland and Poland , but today a new model of cooperation was launched between the three Baltic States and Belarus .
the Minister for Agriculture of Estonia - the sound of the sound - Val@@ dor Se@@ e@@ der stressed that Latvia is currently active in the field of agriculture , with the likelihood of growing .
the Minister also announced that the next budget for Estonia for the next year is three key priorities , one of which is agriculture .
on Wednesday , 9 December Bon@@ n , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis , became a private entreprene@@ uri@@ al private enterprise for the promotion of private enterprise policy .
the prize was awarded by Mr Peter Jun@@ gen , President of the EU , who stressed that the main objective of the prize is to shape the EU &apos;s policy more in a more SME@@ -@@ friendly way .
the Lat@@ vian Prime Minister than@@ ked the SME Union for its recognition and the contribution made to the development of an investment friendly and efficient business environment in Europe .
V__DOT__ Dom@@ bro@@ vskis stressed that the SME Uni@@ on@@ network has contributed to the idea that micro-@@ economic support measures in Latvia are introduced .
the Lat@@ vian Government has taken steps not only to ensure fiscal sustainability but also develop a support programme for the Lat@@ vian micro-@@ economy which is aimed at reducing obstacles to micro-@@ economic activity and encouraging unemployed people to start their business .
in order to achieve the objective , the government has adopted a decision to reduce the requirements of the company ’ s free capital and registration costs , simplified tax information and accounting procedures and ensuring financial support for micro@@ economic activities .
in his speech , Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are a driving force for the economy , contributing to the decline in unemployment , long-term development and stability .
we have already announced that , on dates 8-@@ 10 December , Prime Minister Val@@ dis Dom@@ bro@@ vskis will attend the Con@@ gress of the European People &apos;s Party in Bon@@ n , Germany .
the governance group of reforms has agreed to the inter@@ connected exchange of information signed on Monday 2 November , on Monday 2 November , making an assessment of the work of the current group and bringing the structural reforms to the fore .
the exchange of information corresponds to the cooperation model established by the government and non-governmental bodies representing the joint responsibility for the socio-economic situation in the country , Latvia &apos;s international commitments and their impact on future developments .
the governance group has set priorities for these tasks , focusing directly on the competitiveness , growth and recovery of the country .
the group stresses that the assessment of the combined core functions carried out and the ra@@ tional use of potential sources of public budgets has been progress in defining the reduction of funding in accordance with the results of the tasks and the assessment of functions aimed at elimin@@ ating line@@ ar financing .
although agreement was reached on objectives - small and efficient administration , expansion of internal and external markets for Latvia and promoting employment - shared the group &apos;s general opinion on the need to continue to work towards a clearer framework for the future structural reforms .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ management Group believes that it is necessary to continue the active introduction of social security measures , measures contained in economic recovery plans aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and attra@@ cting investment , a prof@@ ound analysis of the role of micro-@@ economic activities and the introduction of the concept of business in the organisation of the service .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ management Group has accepted the need to accelerate the introduction of EU programmes , which have been delayed over the current period and achieved five years of the year , also reflecting the need to implement the medium-term budget , by linking the external market to future development priorities , by creating an attractive investment climate for future development priorities .
the Re@@ for@@ mi@@ an Group was set up in July 2009 with a view to ensuring public participation in reducing the budget and making decisions .
on 26 November and 27 November , the International Conference in R@@ iga held an international conference in the European Union .
Latvia and Estonia agree jointly to lease the diplomatic representation of the territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt .
since 1 January 2010 , Latvia and Estonia work together in the ren@@ ted complex in the Egy@@ p@@ tian Arab Republic opti@@ mising their administrative costs .
the agreement was reached between the Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ stin@@ s and the Foreign Minister Ur@@ mas Pa@@ eti in the course of his official visit to Rio on 18 February , this year , and ended with the following talks between Foreign Ministers .
this initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Baltic States in the light of the Presidency of the Baltic Council of Ministers in 2010 , which will be taken by Latvia in 2010 in order to introduce similar projects in the future .
the Lat@@ vian emb@@ ass@@ y in C@@ air@@ o has acted since 2007 , which was officially opened in March 2009 during the visit of Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ stin@@ s to Egypt .
since 2010 , Estonia ’ s Represen@@ tation will start in Egypt on premises which are ren@@ ted with Latvia .
Latvia is represented by Mar@@ is Sel@@ ga since the Arab Republic of Egypt .
the Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ stin@@ si phone conversation with Russia &apos;s Foreign Minister called for a quick solution to the situation of freight carriers at the Lat@@ vian border .
on Wednesday , the Foreign Minister Mar@@ is R@@ ie@@ k@@ stin@@ s and the Russian Federation took place between the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation , both parties discussed the results of relations between countries in 2009 , as well as the current developments in the situation of the Russian border .
both foreign ministers shared the view that the situation of mutual relations in this year could generally be assessed posi@@ tively .
next , ministers reviewed the agenda in the forthcoming year of EU-Russia relations , including further improvements in the legal framework , such as a number of important agreements between governments to sign .
Ministers and La@@ vro@@ v also discussed the current situation on freight carriers at the Lat@@ vian and Russian border .
as a result of the increased customs controls of the Russian Federation , the situation is dra@@ matic and the border of Latvia is a dra@@ matic solution to release the Lat@@ vian side of Latvia , because it causes significant losses , the foreign minister , RI@@ EK@@ ST@@ IN@@ S .
Ministers agreed that the respective institutions of both countries , including the Lat@@ vi@@ jas Association for Lat@@ vi@@ jas Au@@ to , should continue efforts to nor@@ mal@@ ise the situation in the near future according to the agreement reached on 18 December of the Inter@@ governmental Pan@@ el on Transport .

dear Sir ,
I recently ordered a new pair of shoes ( commodity code # 6@@ 54@@ 29@@ 51 ) on your website on 21 June .
I got the order on June 26 .
unfortunately , when I opened it , I saw the shoes used .
the shoes were all the dir@@ t and the little tea@@ r was part of the front , where the left toe goes .
my order number is AF@@ 26@@ 16@@ 8@@ 156 .
to solve the problem , I would like you to transfer money to my account , which was asked for their shoes .
I &apos;ve already gone and bought a new pair of shoes from the local sports store , so the second pair would have two pair of same shoes .
thank you for reading this letter for time .
I have been your company &apos;s satisfaction for many years and this is the first time I have encountered a problem .
if you need contact with me , you &apos;ll catch me at 55@@ 5-@@ 55@@ 55 .

dear Miss Col@@ ing :
my name is Susan Harris and I will write to Lo@@ ck@@ wood High Sch@@ ool students .

your coming would honor us .
please respond by Monday 26 February to confirm your presence .
we hope to see you here ,
sin@@ ce@@ rely , Susan Harris .
in 2007 , the most powerful partic@@ le accele@@ rated partic@@ le accele@@ ra@@ tor , the new Lar@@ ge H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der Col@@ li@@ der , measure the secrets of the energy in the energy state that were only mom@@ ents after the Big P@@ au@@ ku .
let the partic@@ les fail if they move close to light speed , hoping to find information on the matter in the past , using the energy released in the event of col@@ lis@@ ion .
what is expected of this great investment that Europe has made to produce the L@@ H@@ C ?
it s@@ ends two pro@@ ton spe@@ eds , partic@@ les that form the at@@ om@@ ic core and which belong to the partic@@ le family , in different direc@@ tions in the lon@@ gi@@ tu@@ dinal range of 27 km , located under Switzerland and France .
to speed up the pro@@ ton and to ensure that they are closed to nar@@ row speed , strong magnetic fields are required , these fields are generated by super@@ conduc@@ tors , materials that are capable of driving electricity without hind@@ rance or which have been produced in cooperation with European industry .
the pro@@ ton col@@ lis@@ ion will take place at a speed of eight million times a second in a massive energy amount of 14 TE@@ V .
in order to understand the size of this figure , 1 TE@@ V is about the amount of energy used to move a flying mo@@ squ@@ i@@ to .
in the L@@ H@@ C , it will be concentrated in a million times less than a bu@@ g .
as energy can be transferred to partic@@ les according to a limited relative relative energy equival@@ ence principle ( represented by E = m@@ c@@ 2 ) , physi@@ c@@ ists rely on partic@@ les that have never been observed in spe@@ eds .
the frequency and intensity of col@@ lis@@ i@@ ons are important as they make the possibility of a larger partic@@ le appearance more visible .
two core nuclear spe@@ eds are also emerging , with energy reaching 1 150 Te@@ v , but a few seconds per second .
search for super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try __DOT____DOT__.
certain sen@@ sors are capable of analy@@ sing the impact .
the two names are C@@ MS ( Com@@ pac@@ t Mu@@ on Sol@@ en@@ oid ) and At@@ las ( A To@@ ro@@ ida@@ l L@@ H@@ C Ap@@ para@@ tus ) .
they focus on detection of super@@ sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal partic@@ les and Higgins .
what &apos;s a super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ?
partic@@ le physi@@ cs contain several sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cs , such as matter and anti@@ matter .
Super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try bin@@ ds fer@@ mi@@ on ( construction material for the matter , such as elec@@ tr@@ ons and blocks ) with each boss ( transfer the transfer , such as phot@@ on ) and vice ver@@ sa .
the challenge lies in the fact that super@@ sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try ( also assigned to the part ) has never been seen before .
how to dis@@ cover them ?
par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , by their absence !
&quot; it &apos;s kind of like being a movie .
you count the number and type of people entering and out .
if any person has disappeared at the end , because you know who entered the door , you can guess who did not .
in the same way , the L@@ H@@ C tests are known to result in these anti@@ partic@@ les that are in@@ visible to all sen@@ sors .
before the impact on the partic@@ le energy , they compare the energy of the partic@@ les which occurred after the impact .
if there are differences in energy , part has escap@@ ed .
in calculating the missing energy , they know whether the super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try component or anti@@ do@@ te is involved .
the second challenge of c@@ ms and L@@ HS is the detection of the Hig@@ gs boss .
in the case of the reference point of the standard model theory , it is expected that this should be reciproc@@ ity and give them mass .
how ?
let &apos;s assume there &apos;s a room@@ ful of physi@@ cs .
suddenly , Albert E@@ inste@@ in comes into the room , students gather around him and start bom@@ bing his questions .
if Albert tries to move , he knows a firm iner@@ tia , because of the students that are sta@@ mped on him .
he &apos;s similar to these partic@@ les as the Hig@@ gs boss trying to intera@@ ct with them - they collect mass .
as well as the expected dis@@ co@@ very of their famous bos@@ ton@@ s , it is only circumst@@ anti@@ al : partic@@ les that result from their degradation , they are what they are discovered .
K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ glu@@ on sou@@ p
the third sen@@ sor , which L@@ H@@ C is equipped , is called Alice ( big ion accele@@ ra@@ tor experi@@ ment ) .
it aims to detect parts of the unknown nuclear physi@@ cs , especially the matter of matter , which exis@@ ted in a very short time after the Big P@@ au@@ ku , and known as a quar@@ ter-@@ gu@@ lon@@ i plasma name .
what &apos;s the new speci@@ fici@@ ties ?
in the &apos; 60@@ s , scientists realized that pro@@ ton and neutr@@ ali@@ zed , which formed the nuclear core , were made even more of the original partic@@ les - blocks from blocks .
these blocks are strong forces ( which are gu@@ ided by a name called glu@@ on ) with each other .
one of their own is that they are diverse together : they are always either in ma@@ ts or tri@@ ps ; they cannot exist alone .
the more you try to iso@@ late K@@ var@@ k from another quarter , the greater the force that keeps them together , making them permanently un@@ isolated .
the quar@@ ks say they &apos;re in prison .
however , if the pro@@ ton bom@@ bs are to be bom@@ bed against each other in large energy , the sou@@ p and sou@@ p containing glu@@ on@@ es will be set up in which blocks can move freely .
then we can refer to the release of blocks in the quar@@ ter-@@ glu@@ on sou@@ p .
what kind of release ?
&quot; this is somewhat comparable to ski@@ ing .
if there is not much s@@ now , the run@@ way can be separated by gras@@ s and ski@@ ers are limited to their construction .
on the other hand , if there &apos;s a lot of s@@ now , they can change the path .
they are free from restrictions __DOT__ &amp; quot ;
instead of s@@ now , physi@@ c@@ ists add energy : the greater the power of the block , the weak@@ er power , so the level of energy can be separated from the level of energy .
the plasma presence of K@@ var@@ gi@@ -@@ glu@@ on was probably a matter of micro@@ seconds after the Big P@@ au@@ ku .
this is why physi@@ c@@ ists want to examine it through the ion@@ ic ir@@ ons created by the L@@ H@@ C .
by nature , they are very rich in pro@@ ton and neutr@@ ons .
they may achieve energy 1 150 TE@@ V , which is necessary for the plasma of the quar@@ ter-@@ glu@@ on , which was un@@ prec@@ eden@@ ted at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse , to create and investigate .
my@@ ster@@ y of anti@@ matter
finally , the last sen@@ sor called L@@ HC@@ b ( a large H@@ ad@@ ron of H@@ ad@@ ron ) .
it is a task for a better monitoring of small differences between the matter and the anti@@ matter , so that it can better understand what happened to the anti@@ matter of the universe .
for each part of the part , an anti@@ body is the same as the same mass , but the opposite charge .
therefore , there is a negative mass for electronic communications , but an anti@@ electric ( or posi@@ tr@@ on ) with a positive loan .
if the electricity and the anti@@ electric get together , they will destroy each other , the result is the energy pressure .
in accordance with the standard model of physi@@ cs physi@@ cs , an equal quantity of matter and anti@@ matter was created at the beginning of the universe .
so all the partic@@ les should destroy each other and the universe should be empty .
however , as anyone can see , the matter is high .
this is where this question comes from , which L@@ HC@@ b is trying to answer : where is the anti@@ matter ?
one of the possible answers is based on the ability of certain partic@@ les to change themselves to their anti@@ qu@@ ities and vice ver@@ sa .
in this case , the presence of the matter depends on the hypo@@ the@@ sis ( waiting for proof ) that the transformation of the anti@@ partic@@ les into partic@@ les is addi@@ cted to the opposite transformation at the beginning of the universe .
can this im@@ balance be demonstrated ?
it &apos;s actually been experi@@ mentally examined with partic@@ les of the block called the cabin .
the An@@ tika@@ a@@ ons are trans@@ formed spon@@ taneously into the on@@ set , but there is a lot less frequent .
L@@ HC@@ b is investi@@ gating another candidate , B-@@ mes@@ on , which contains the basic component ( or an anti@@ que ) which is called a B block or a dec@@ or@@ ative ( from where L@@ CH@@ b is also char@@ ming ) .
although the partic@@ les cannot be seen , they can be detected .
to this end , L@@ H@@ C equipped with a number of con@@ cen@@ tric la@@ yers ( such as oni@@ on ) , surroun@@ ded by partic@@ le speed , where the col@@ lis@@ ion occurs .
every la@@ yer speci@@ ali@@ zes in dete@@ cting a particular type .
in the middle of the sen@@ sor , there are a number of millions of leaders inside that chamber that produce a power pul@@ se when a part of it goes .
these impul@@ ses are recorded by compu@@ ters .
there &apos;s a magnetic field inside every sen@@ sor .
it will help detect and investigate the partic@@ le ( e__DOT__g__DOT__ electric or pro@@ ton ) tra@@ jec@@ tory , which is sensitive to magnetic fields .
second , the device is a cal@@ ori@@ meter pro@@ position .
some cal@@ ories stop partic@@ les like phot@@ ons or elec@@ tr@@ ons , but others are designed to stop neutr@@ ons and phot@@ ons .
they measure the partic@@ le loss of the partic@@ les .
assistance from st@@ rings
how to define the nature of the al@@ go@@ sa@@ tes separated from the mechanisms leading to their creation ?
apart from the standard model of physi@@ cs ( resulting in qu@@ an@@ tum mechan@@ ics ) , modern science has concentrated its hopes fully on the new concept that would offer a high level of ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical theory .
this a@@ th@@ le@@ tes the prospect of a completely new type of experi@@ mentation in CER@@ N .
standard model ( the cor@@ ner@@ stone of modern physi@@ cs , which was taken at the centre of the 20th century ) , must be the exact components of the basic components that are driven by three partic@@ les of the particula@@ te matter : electro@@ magnet@@ ism and strong and weak forces .
this will allow us to offer descri@@ ptions that fit very well with what is going on in this end@@ less@@ ly small world .
however , this model does not take into account the fourth interaction - gra@@ vity .
now , qu@@ an@@ tum physi@@ cs , when the light presents itself with a partic@@ le , foot@@ on , with gra@@ vity , the gra@@ vity of gra@@ vity must be transferred to another part , gra@@ vit@@ on .
search for harmonisation
as a result of this part of the standard model , there is an obstacle ( see box ) .
in addition , at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse , the universe was both extremely small and extreme ( total energy and matter concentrated in very small spaces ) .
consequently , the theory also descri@@ bes the partic@@ les that domin@@ ated the previously domin@@ ated period , cannot be left aside .
how do we comb@@ ine all this general rela@@ tivity theory ( out of E@@ inste@@ in at the beginning of the last century ) , which turns fully gra@@ vity around ?
&amp; quot ; The harmonisation of qu@@ an@@ tum mechan@@ ics and the overall rela@@ tivity theory has become the real Holy Gra@@ il of physi@@ cs .
scientists are working on this problem .
the most promising route seems to be a st@@ ring theory __DOT__ &amp; quot ;
points to the points
what does this theory tell us about the world ?
first , it will look at the partic@@ les , but if the elements , which can be compared with extremely small st@@ rings which are a 10-@@ 35 metres long ( for a number of 35 zer@@ o@@ es , the first of them is on the left side ) .
these st@@ rings vibra@@ ting and the nature of their vibra@@ tions match the partic@@ les of partic@@ les .
the more st@@ ring vibra@@ tes , the greater the amount of the energy .
one st@@ ring theory that is necessary for its ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical integrity is super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try .
to understand what it is , a short description of the basic partic@@ les &apos; zo@@ ology &apos; is necessary .
K@@ van@@ t@@ ke@@ had in the universe will be divided into two families : on the one hand there is fer@@ mi@@ ons composed of elec@@ tr@@ ons and blocks , on the other side of the bos@@ ton@@ ite family where the fundamental links are to be used , as the phot@@ ons of electro@@ magnetic power , and gra@@ vit@@ on ( mentioned above ) for gra@@ vit@@ on .
Super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try problem
Super@@ sy@@ m@@ me@@ try consists of the assu@@ mption that every part of the fer@@ mi@@ on family corresponds to a partic@@ le belonging to the boss &apos;s family and vice ver@@ sa , so the sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal idea .
the Super@@ sy@@ m@@ metri@@ cal part has not yet been detected , but the partic@@ les of the partic@@ le physi@@ cs are counting on them with a high energy impact which they will soon create using L@@ H@@ C , a new partic@@ le accele@@ rated accele@@ ration in the L@@ H@@ C .
in the meantime , as@@ tron@@ om@@ ers may indirectly monitor the effects of my@@ steri@@ ous partic@@ les , as the total mass of g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies and g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies appears to be much greater than the gener@@ ous mass ( letters , gases , etc __DOT__ ) detected by the tele@@ sc@@ op@@ ic tele@@ sc@@ op@@ es .
they therefore pos@@ se@@ ss the presence of in@@ visible black mass which is reci@@ pro@@ cal with other matter only through gra@@ vity , and contains very stable , so very mild partic@@ les .
there are a number of key features that the ligh@@ test super@@ sy@@ me@@ try partic@@ les share .
these may therefore be un@@ familiar with the black mass ingredients , the phenomenon of which was examined for the first time by Switzerland by the as@@ tron@@ om@@ y F@@ rit@@ z Z@@ w@@ icky in 19@@ 33 .
four interactions between single interactions
another issue that is proble@@ matic for researchers concerns the four fundamental interactions of nature .
why are their streng@@ ths so different from each other ?
for example , gra@@ vita@@ tional interactions are much weak@@ er than that of electro@@ magnetic interactions .
it is proof that the magnetic field is a sufficient magnetic field to attract a relatively large metal mass , while the gra@@ vity of the same mass is needed to move the same mass .
one question is that all the basic interactions are only one of the most influ@@ ential interactions that began to fall at the beginning of the Uni@@ verse .
business stability is vital to the success of business .
and in the modern world , vir@@ tually every company has a vulner@@ ability to inter@@ ruption .
some risks can interrup@@ t your business for days , but in the competitive environment , even four hours can be fatal .
due to the increase in the number of risks affecting business , the approach of the worst scenario &amp; quot ; insurance policy &amp; quot ; has become a worrying concern for sustainability .
but how to define the flexibility and recovery requirements of our business ?

in order to think about the infrastructure , a global and global perspective must be thought in a modern environment .
access to information is critical and it is an obligation that the risk cannot afford to afford .
in the event of ob@@ s@@ olete or reduced performance , intensi@@ ties are gradually growing and the problem is dra@@ matically dis@@ tra@@ cted by the rest@@ oration of information and the loss of injury .
IB@@ M storage and data services help customers prevent such tra@@ ge@@ dies and ensure that information is safely available at any time , all the time .
IB@@ M Global Technology Services provide services to services
help , enabling customers to obtain in@@ tel on how they use their LO@@ Bs and determine the best use of storage media throughout the company ,
provide broad information for the arch@@ ive strategy ,
help maxi@@ mise the value of information by reducing risks to customers &apos; business , which emer@@ ges as a result of the management of bad information infrastructure .
and since the information infrastructure must meet every 4-@@ key key in order to manage information successfully - access to information , preservation , security and coordination - calls for the movement of data , then our Data Mo@@ bility S@@ olu@@ tions are just to do so .
we are going to the details of the migration of the data to make sure that we reduce the risks to the client at each business target , helping the company to reduce the complexity of IT and reduce costs .
in implementing a well-@@ organised approach to the media and data environment , you will benefit from advantages arising from the efficient infrastructure for farming .
you can provide access to data for commercial users , giving key decision-@@ makers information that they need for renewal and profit .
you will be able to offer a cost efficiency that meets current needs , while the strong foundation for the future for the future .
you can also better manage business risks and support regulatory compliance .
broad approach to storage and data
IB@@ M Global Technology Services Services provide services that will help you to end the storage and data needs , including assessment , planning , design , introduction and management .
services shall include :
the optimis@@ ation and integration services of IB@@ M - help you reduce complexity , opti@@ mise performance and manage growth by creating cost-effective , s@@ cal@@ able and flexible storage infrastructure
