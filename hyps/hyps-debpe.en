the aim of this report is to describe the steps to be taken to build a function of personalization functionality – to clarify the PH strategy and operations .
there is currently no investment department PH-functionality .
the idea of this report was the EUPCU leader in the debate on 22 September .
however , the content of the PH-plate was also discussed with other entities : Anita Bisofa , Valda Ceputers and Valdis Bisters .
the Moe Investment Department is growing rapidly and stands at the moment of many changes with many changes .
possible changes in the department &apos;s organisation are already at stake .
the pressure to address effective and reticularly work processes and personalhums is invading .
in the current situation , directors and units of units have been attracted to the projects , so that there is no time to develop PH .
it is recommended that the person responsible for PH be appointed , who can focus on the establishment of the personalization system and would be able to further develop it in accordance with practical needs .
prior to the investment department PH planning , the mission and mission of the department must be clear .
the strategy of the Investigation Division and the short term action plan is recommended once a year .
Eli , but also in national programmes should be stressed in accordance with actual needs .
the number of projects is expected to increase significantly and progressively increasing the implementation of the implementation phase , which affects the number of workers required and their field of competence .
the key is the PRK ( the Handbook of implementation of the project ) and PKJ ( project management instructions ) .
they should be used in this autumn .
the PRK shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the relevant processes .
these instructions provide practical guidance on both the flow of work and the organisation .
these instructions should serve as a basis for the following pillars such as writing and identifying areas of competence .
the measures necessary for the development and further practical use of the personnel management system shall be described in Annex III .
the initial plan for setting up the PH-system is set out in Annex IV .
the plan would be a presumption that the personalizer / coordinator can start working with PH in the beginning of December 2003 .
the Director of the Department and the Head of Unit should cooperate closely with the staff member , to inform him of the need for continuous development and prioritise it .
they are also responsible for the development and performance of the development of the debate ; staff management will contribute to the discussion of Maltese modernisation and storage files .
the leaders of the units must play an active role in developing the themes and content of the fields of competence .
all personnel are involved in the self-evaluation of the fuses .
staff management shall coordinate the assessment of competencies and manage data files .
the 2004 budget draft budget must be covered by both PH development costs ( mainly PH-worker , units , IT-employee pay costs ) and the cost of training .
implementation costs include direct costs ( e.g. courses , lecturers , materials ) , teaching and training , training , training and training of trainers , and training and facilitation of training by PH-worker .
once a year , the cost of the lost working time is also due to the assessment and PLP-interview .
an approximate assessment of the 2004 training activities must be provided before the provision of any budget figures .

with a view to meeting the Supreme Council meeting of March 2005 , Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for the years 2008 ( the &amp; quot ; programme &amp; quot ; ) , with a view to promoting the growth and growth of the country .
the programme is a policy planning document , which shows how Latvia will achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the years to 2008 , by the Council endorsed by the Council in July 2005 .
the programme will be warranted to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , the most important challenges for Latvia and the main features of actions and actions to tackle these problems , but also the performance indicators for achieving these objectives .
the programme is based on the draft policy planning documents approved by Latvia .
the development of the programme was assisted by the Lisbon Council .
they were consulted on the Seim ( Latvia Parliament ) and the social partners .
the programme includes the introduction of the main part ( macro economic policy , microeconomic reforms , guidelines for employment policy ) and annexes .
all numerical information and arsenic data from the statistical official of Latvia , or Eurostat , except in specific cases .
in order to achieve these objectives , the ministerial priorities will be the development of strategic plans , in order to prepare for the strategic planning key elements of the 2007 budget , in line with the priorities set by the government in terms of medium-term development objectives and orientations and programmes , including their funding , and , inter alia , their financing .
to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro ,
took the ministers &apos; cover on 21 July 2005 to decide to establish a European single currency in Latvia with the task of the Commission to develop a plan for the necessary measures to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro .
on 31 December 2004 , public debt amounted to 975 million latinc or 13,3 % of GDP .
it is expected that public debt will increase further in the next years and may reach 13.6 % of GDP in 2008 .
Latvia &apos;s sovereign debt is one of the smallest , and is expected to remain below the average of the country &apos;s gross national debt in the medium term ( 60 % of GDP ) as defined in the Maastricht contract .
on the basis of the information provided , Latvia does not have a pressing need to develop a specific plan to reduce public debt , but before taking any action in the area of management of the public debt , possible risk must be analysed in order to ensure the most favourable national performance .
the main planned actions in the area of public debt for the year 2008 ( Guideline 2 ) .
to ensure the necessary resources to finance the public budget deficit and to refinance public debt as minimum costs and conditions as favourable as possible , limiting financial risk and taking into account the development of the State capital market and all financial systems ( responsible authority :
– to develop new debt refinancing and debt exchange programmes for the management of debt rises in order to capitalise on the opportunities offered by the capital market without longer-term resources ;
the reduction of the costs incurred by the national foreign debt in the Twelve States will be reviewed by all existing provisions of the external loan agreements in order to assess the future repayment of several loans in the future , refinancing these loans with other favourable loans or possible restrictions on the possibility and existing restrictions .
the sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed positively and is characterised by a low level of public debt , but also a sufficient budgetary discourse .
Latvia &apos;s dedication to the Stability and Growth Pact requirements , but also in fulfilling the objective of joining the euro area , is another positive guarantee for the current fiscal position .
in a long-term perspective , the sustainability of public finances is mainly influenced by the ageing of the population , which causes the working age population and their role in the population and the increase in demographic burdens .
the initial calculations of financial sustainability show that the ageing of the population influences Latvia &apos;s society and the country &apos;s domestic and public finances , but it will not result in an insurmountable effect on the pension reform .
Latvia ’ s small debt and rising pressure surpluses will provide the government with a sound flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances .
it should be noted , however , that the ageing population will test the health system in a new way .
the distribution of health costs according to age groups clearly shows that higher costs will fall to older people , whose number is noticeably rising over the next 50 years .
long-term maintenance costs are currently relatively small in Latvia , which is justified by the limited use of the national government and local governments , but also from society &apos;s traditions and values .
at the same time , the health hosts of other demographic groups must also be ensured , as the overall level of hospitality is high .
the government will develop an effective health system based on long-term prospects .
changes in the country &apos;s monetary policy are needed to adapt significantly to the current diversity of democratisation situations .
in the long term , the increase in GDP growth based on improved labour productivity growth plays a crucial role in improving the lifestyle of all population groups .
it is therefore important to ensure that Latvia &apos;s main wealth – training of people in line with labour market demands – to create a labour market for all ( see section 3 ) .
a major contribution to the overall development of the national economy is also a major contribution to the forest , as it meets the requirements of the raw material of the wood processing , the largest export sector in Latvia .
the forest is also an important resource for rural development , since it provides a livelihood for local people working in different areas , 150 000 forest owners and the forest owners .
the income generated by the final and harmonious radar or services shall be invested by the forest owner in the conservation or continuous production of the forest .
the largest forest owners ( the country , local governments and some private-sector companies to whom thousands of hexacks are owed to forests ) can ensure continuous production processes throughout the long term .
taking into account the composition of tree species , age , structure , previous administrative practice , the economic situation of rural areas , but also forest owners &apos; awareness of forest owners is a deterrent for small forest owners .
due to the circumstances of the general nature of the case , there is currently an insufficient amount of investment in the value of the value of forests ( farms ) ; therefore , it is necessary to promote purified productivity ( the use of forests in the forest , the cultivation of selected forests ) , the use of the wood in the forest .
although Latvia &apos;s waste management systems have been complemented and the awareness of society about the need to reduce the spread of prunes has increased , the flagship of the prone to each year is growing .
the options for the treatment and utility process are insufficient , although companies can obtain the environmental damage generated by the environmental protection fund from Latvia from the environmental protection fund and the production and utility of waste .
water infrastructure infrastructures ( water supply and collection and installation of water ) are insufficiently developed and obsolete , its capacity is not economically justified , the technology used is energy intensive and not all environmental requirements .
it restricts the development of the activity , the prerogative of the country in remote regions .
access to water management infrastructure is influenced by the development of public utility services , social security , health and tourism .
Latvia has to determine the deadline for transposition of internal market rules , but also to ensure supervision of the national management and political level of supervision of the Directives .
in the case of 7 September 2005 , Latvia had not notified 1,3 % of the transposition of the EU Directives ( or 0.5 % of the total number of directives ) .
given that 99,5 % of the Directives had been transposed in Latvia ’ s normalisation of 7 September 2005 , it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective is to be achieved , at least 98.5 % of the transposition , or a deficit of 1,5 % of the transposition deficit .
the transposition and implementation of the Internal Market Directives will depend directly on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation .
there is no effective EU-wide monitoring of the transposition of EU legislation , which would provide an opportunity to monitor over the time frame set out in the directive ’ s transposition process , and thus , in addition to other circumstances , delays the transposition process and the creation of the EU internal market .
the public administration of public administrations will reduce their ability to ensure that the EU Directives are adopted and correctly replied to in Latvia .
restrictions on the freedoms of the internal market in Eli had been lost in most of the EU before Latvia joined the EU , but there are still obstacles to the transposition .
significant obstacles arise from existing operational requirements and time-consuming administrative operations requiring companies to receive additional money and time and the worst of small and medium-sized enterprises .
it is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and validity of existing different licensing and other restrictions on the EU requirements , including free professions ( solicitors , notaries , accountants , archestics , engineers and farm animals ) in order to promote competition in these sectors .
in order to streamline the unified and harmonised competition policy , there was a harmonisation of competition norms in 2004 , according to the requirements of EU competition trends .
in order to overcome obstacles to competition across borders , or to prevent potential distortions of competition , the Competition Authority ( NCA ) - the Competition Council - active cooperation with the Commission and the competition with national competition authorities is launched .
the Elektrian market is a lake .
in the case of 1 July 2004 , the status of the free customers of the free customer of 0,0 GWh was designated as legal persons .
therefore , only residential buildings cannot be selected and the electricity market is guaranteed to 75 % .
there has not been a free consumer switched to the current place .
in order to encourage competition and encourage the market penetration of alternative suppliers , the functions of electricity supply and distribution are legally and functionally separated from the functions of electricity generation and sales .
the conditions for electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law .
I will build our common future and take global commitments , using only 1 % of their prosperity per year .
the focus of the foreclosure decisions is to respond to the invitation to our society in the interests of the better life of the EU citizens in today &apos;s world .
the European Parliament is the only one directly elected by the EU .
we will find information on this part of our web site , how Parliament will organise its work through a different committee system .
Parliament has an active role to play in drawing up legislation affecting the everyday life of its citizens , such as environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods , as well as the free movement of the European Union &apos;s annual budget .
the European Parliament is composed of 736 members elected in the 27 Member States of the European Union .
since 1979 , MEPs have been elected in direct and universal elections for five years .
each Member State shall decide on what forms are organised , but must comply with the common democratic rule rules : gender equality and the secret vote .

with paralysis , they must , of course , devote time to their circuits .
members of the European Parliament will be grouped in one of the political views , not by nationality .
they &apos;re using their mandate undependent .
as the European Parliament ’ s potential is increasing , they will affect all the citizens &apos; everyday life area : environmental , consumer protection , transport , and education , culture , health , etc .

what would be better to ensure the transparency and accessibility of Parliament &apos;s work throughout the public ?
in the European treaties , multilingualism , which is firmly rooted in the European treaties , is a cornerstone of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union .
it also makes European institutions more accessible to public access and transparency , which will help to ensure the success of the EU &apos;s democratic system .
the European Parliament distinguishes from other EU institutions to ensure a multilingualism in the largest possible way .
all EU citizens must be able to acquaint themselves with legislation directly affecting them in their national language .
and since every European citizen has the right to deporte the European Parliament in the elections , it is unreasonable to require members of the members to be able to warmly overwhelm .
each Member State shall be entitled to read the documents in their language , to monitor the deliberations and to take the floor clearly laid down in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure .
in addition , the European Parliament , as the legislator , must ensure that all the legislative acts adopted are good in all official languages in all official languages .
in addition , the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament &apos;s work , ask questions and receive answers in their language .
the European Parliament in its resolution of 9 October states that &amp; quot ; experience gained from previous European elections and referenda shows that they are more likely to take part in those who are aware of the issues related to the EU and the participation of less informised citizens are less likely ” .
on the eve of October 2009 , the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration &amp; quot ; Communicating Europe about Communicating Europe &amp; quot ; in order to emphasise the need for political preparedness for all EU institutions and Member States at all levels of the EU .
the main objective of the Joint Declaration is to provide citizens with a fair and multi-faceted information on the EU , so that they can take active action in the public debate in the public debate .
with the Joint Declaration the EU took the task of resolving the problems in cooperation with Member States , in cooperation with the Member States , in order to ensure the right level of gender at the right level .
in this context , they expressed their desire to develop synthesis of national , regional and local authorities and civil society representatives .
each Member State and each institution have their own communication trades and its priorities , agreed by Parliament , the Council and the Commission to establish a single set of communication priorities for a single year .

he wasn &apos;t the only son of his father , even though he was the oldest of the brothers , his brother William in the chairwoman of his business in Cuckold in his business .
in several parts of the MORGANs , but the MORGANs of the Richard clan , who thought they had migrated in the sneezes , were already living in a sufficiently contempt to achieve a sound position in order to achieve a sound position of the clan .
Richard &apos;s father wasn &apos;t one of them .
after a brief study of the primary school , he &apos;s in the bakery , and later , as a free man who has paid his tracks , he tried to stay in the face of the pumpkin owner .
he was also organised socially appropriate , and Margaret Biggs came from a gang from Bedminsterter from a gang of wealth , and he became a asset , including reading literacy .
kids , the first girl , you came to the weather with a sufficient frequency , so they &apos;re gonna have some dead pain and grief .
if Dick learned to rule so much to pull out before ejaculating , the number of children stayed with two living sons and three girls .
a para paste , and a little small enough to care for more .
Dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read and write , and his hopes focused on Richard when it was clear that two years ago , the noble william schoolmate is not .
so if Richard had become seven years old , he was the Colston Poisslasteschool and had a famous blue coat that declared bristolans that his father was poor , but his father was honorable .
and followed by five years of tamboskedness and skill skills .
he learned a handsome hand to write , the deceased to calculate himself through the Caesar Gallia wars , Cicero calls and the Ovidius Metamorphosis , the scum of the cupboard .
because he was a good nobleman , a jewelry from a distance , and a whiff of whiff of silence , he got out of the colonel &apos;s charitable school from Colston .
at the age of 12 , it was time to leave the old-fashioned business , and to find a business or an invitation to work at the level of education .
however , for the great surprise of the soup , he chose not to have the same activities of the MORGANs .
his biggest forgiveness turned out to be a mechanic , a piece of pieces of things ; it was accompanied by an admirable patience for a young man .
and on my own choice , he became a male boy at Tomas Habitat , who had a gun to his office .
my father had a decision on a quiet joy , he was sentencing that one of the Morgans growing into a craftsman , not a long-distance .
well , the war was part of life , and the war went off .
a man who prepares the weapon and repaired , didn &apos;t vague the threat of a battle in a cannon .
for Richarďs , seven years old , the seven-year-old is happy with the work and the season , the fear of physical pleasure .
like the other boys , he worked for a man &apos;s house , a housekeeper &apos;s house , served him at the dinner table , filled the stomach with the leftovers and slept on the ground .
fortunately , the Lord Tomas Habitas was a good host and even a better gun .
well , he was able to prepare the fabulous duels and hunting guns , he had enough to understand that they had to be in Manton , but Manton couldn &apos;t be in Manton .
so was his work , the 46-inch cannons called &quot; Pruuniise Bessix &quot; in the war , and the 46-inch cannons , and still the shell of the sun .
at the age of 11 , Richard became a master certificate and moved out of Habitas , but not his workshop .
there he continued to work as a weapon of arms in Pruundi Besside .
and he &apos;s helpless , as long as the female bodyguard in the bowls had been restored .
she became a daughter of his mother &apos;s brother , maybe the cousins , but that Inglise &apos;s rack , he was not in the face of his girlfriend .
the marriage was arranged , but there was a love of love between the wives of years in gold .
the jewelry represented some confusion about the son of Richard Morgans and Margaret Briggs , Richard Morgan , who took his own wife to Margaret Briggs .
as long as Habitas crawled with a full ramp , there was nothing strange , because young couple of eyebrows in the repent correness of Avon Streek , Habitat Street , Habitas , and Jewish synagogue , were a long-distance stone .
the marriage was signed in 1767 , three years after the end of the seven-year war with France , and the victory in debt , despite hard debt , was to increase the taxes and drag the money in order to increase the cocaine .
there was no need for weapons , so you left meisters and the boys in the haunted Habitat from the Jew , until all the companies were still in Richard and Lord Tomas Habitas .
and then , for some time after the little Mary was born in 1770 , Habitas was reluctant to let Richard &apos;s pride .
&quot; for me to work , &quot; Dude , Dick Morgan .
&quot; the weapons are coming and go , but the rum remains . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened , despite the problem .
Richardi &apos;s mother was always called short of Mag and Richard &apos;s wife Peg , both derived from Margaret .
the bigger problem was that all the men of Inglisland , if you were to find out about the protestants , who were baptized into Cranfields and Onesiphorus , were the name of John , William , Margaretes , Elizabeths , and all the women .
it was one of the few things that were fit for everyone , the King &apos;s tension .
&amp; quot ; This is the first time I see this . &amp; quot ;
that halipsos diving diver who was in the face of an evil investigator at the bottom of the stern , and got the word out of the mouth .
he took the ladder to the ladder , took the flames and the mask down and hand them to the waiting ferry .
then he dragged himself out of the water , losing a balance in the cylinders &apos; gravity of the ballast , but landed on the ground as a whole , and a whole ship on deck .
there was a drip in the middle of a bunch of other crews who were already waiting on the diving deck .
Jack Howard went down from the bridge and laughed at the war .
he still couldn &apos;t believe that such a bodywork would be able to move the water net from the water .
the Tagadeck diving gear in tactics opened his mouth , a lovely year in the old one .
&amp; quot ; And we thought you were swimming back to Athens and sitting with the gin and the chauffeur of your father &apos;s pool . &amp; quot ;
the study is not based on climatic calibrations , forecasts or personal opinions , but has assembled many sources , including interviews , arrogance , orientation and hearing .
all data prior to 1990s based on interviews based on interviews and multifaceted newspapers , newspapers and history of newspapers – more precise use of information collection methods used in earlier use .
the graphics of the period after 1988 are based on everything that has taken place over the last 11 years and what I have been reading about about 1000 different studies .
the 2009 and next year &apos;s gragraphic is based on forecasts from me and others for the years ahead .
graphics are not pretending to be a 100 % precision , their aim is to provide a review of the situation and to outline the social media news , targeted communication and other such future .
the purpose of the article is to make people think .
we are currently seeing a completely new way of communicating people - that makes traditional voters simpler .
this is a fundamental change that changes the world , which we feel , fully .
the best thing about this is to help you get this happen .
come along with me to the last 210-year-old .
before we start exploring the future , we &apos;ll look at how we made it today , starting with the fact that we &apos;re going back to 1800 , where finding the info was in the swing .
in the 1800s , people have to go out and meet them .
everything was a face-to-face attitude .
for the sale of the product , you should have gone to the local market and the only possibility to communicate in a general plain was to meet personal or rifle table .
it meant for you that it was right at the right time to obtain information or to provide it .
you didn &apos;t know what happened in the second part of the city , nor did your products sell to people in another place .
they were told about some new contraception called newspaper ...
by 1900 , history and magazines have changed attitudes , allowing us to get news of places where we never had .
we were able to communicate our ideas to people we never saw , and sell his products to others who were far away .
we still have to go out and talk to other people , but we got to be in the middle of nowhere .
it was incredible - the first real revolution .
the world began to open .
since 1920 , a new source of information on the people of the paperwork - the book .
the abrupt audience has heard the voice of another person from hundreds of miles .
but the most important thing was that the latest information was possible in the real time .
it was the next food in the history of information .
however , the fraudulent time of development meant that , in 1960 , the history of our lives in the 1960 domiciled lives .
if you wanted to get the latest news , or introduce people to your products , you would have used the history of this history .
it felt that these are the VALDAVAS for a very long time .
this situation started to change in 1960 .
in the frame of the book , and two main sources of information were broadcast in the history of the news , the more detailed news transmitted by newspapers and magazines and magazines .
it was a great time for media , although some said that the history of the history of the newspaper would be able to take the right time , the argument that we could have heard in a repeated 50 years .
during the next 40 years , the next fact-based evolution was presented .
it started to collect public interest in the 1960s and the beginning of the 1990s was a big , deserting newspaper , and magazines , but the domineer still in the frame .
now , people got infiltrated as well as watching .
the year 1970 was also the time when the publishers of newspapers realized that something was horribly wrong with their sales market .
they had a lot of problems with the drain , but there was another way out of the class .
only two years later , and the prevalence of transmission was dominated by the information world , the deforestation was almost only the &amp; quot ; place where it was to be heard of the music &amp; quot ; and the history of all that was able to remain appropriate .
the constant development of technology continued with persistence , never seen before .
the new phenomenon was spying on the shadows .
1998 was the year when the Internet changed from a wrongful place , which had not much significance , indefinitely , leading to attitude that every company must have a website .
the revolution has started three years earlier , but in 1998 it reached a critical mass and tried to draw attention to all the attention , despite the fact that there was a lack of access to it .
however , everyone agreed that it was the future - a new era of timing .
it was a place where everyone could have infiltrated information everywhere - at least theory .
people started to realize the Internet was more than just info .
when you joined the interview , you got something back and being part of it instead of being a monitor .
however , the most important thing was that you could choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do it .
the Internet options were upgraded .
in 2004 , only six years later , the Internet had changed the way we took the information .
however , there was a domicile and history in our news sources , but the world was certainly the Internet .
people have made new websites and dissolved the world of online applications .
people were able to do so much and participate in so many areas in order to show a new recipe : info overload .
for the first time in my life , we are more information than we can be able to absorb .
in the age of history , we were to choose what we wanted to see .
in 2004 , we must choose what we did not want to see .
it had a destructive effect on the traditional image of info .
it was possible to get people &apos;s attention just to do something .
people wanted more choice , so they just had to give them a new choice .
this change in 2004 , because something different was not enough , it was supposed to be better .
2004 was also a year when another phenomena began to emerge :
this recipe was silent on the plane blogs .
it was a mild , simple and accessible way to share your ideas .
for the first time , everyone had a chance to create their own infosterist , without anything technical .
the treatment of info is a change of professional work for all workers .
three years later , and the Internet social element , the social element of the Internet was in fact .
for the first time there was no more information on info , and history was fought for survival .
everyone wanted to create his little world and connect it to their own friends .
2007 was also a breaking point for traditional websites that people compared to the history of history - a static and passive form of information .
we want an active information .
we want to be part of this , not just to look at it .
blogs started to get into difficulty .
as was the case in the course of the race , it had been removed from the deforestation ( because it was better and more richer for the people in the radar ) , so the social networks removed the blogs .
the social profile is more active for people to share what they care about .
social networks are just better for this , and blogs can &apos;t stay behind it .
two years later , today , the new Internet is going to absorb our world completely .
history is dead in the water and people are looking less at the same time as they do .
we are the new arts of info , using social networking sites to contact and communicate .
even the traditional website will die , which has been killed by a continuous flow of information from the social networks to the ruthless flow of information .
over the last 210 years , we have seen a fascinating development , how we can obtain information .
the main pillars are :
1 .
2 . getting it in the real time .
3 , seeing it in the real time .
4 . decision to look at something and watch .
5 . possibility to take part and candy .
6 .
7 .
2009 is the beginning of the next revolution .
all we know is changing .
the first and most dramatic change is a recipe for social news .
it will take over our need to be in the course of what happens in the world .
the news will no longer pass the magazines , because now it comes from everyone .
they will be sent directly to you , leaving the traditional dietary channels .
instead of the time writer , what the analysts say , the moon is now in his own hands .
the social news will get the news straight and uncensorship .
a new entertainment wave ( blueprint and purple bottles ) which are domiciled in games , video and heleflows .
instead of making a TV channel , you decide what you want to look at and when you want to watch it .
we &apos;re not going to join the channels anymore where someone else decides what we can look at .
you &apos;re checking all the experience .
in the form of an inflationary information , the new concept is silent .
we already see a growing number of mobile telephony services that provide local information on this area where you are located .
for example , instead of pointing out all the world &apos;s restaurants , the phone only shows the list in your area .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to grow up in the next years .
in the world where we have access to more information than we can consume , it is a very important element of obtaining relevant information , expanding much further than a long distance , which we see today .
within the next five or ten years , the world will change .
all traditional forms will eventually die .
the temporal temporal history is no longer exerted , the distribution of the current channels in the form of the current channels is replaced by individual programmes that you wish to see .
the audio programmes are intended to be replaced by pockets and video broadcasts .
websites have a much smaller role : their primary function is the distribution of operational activities that can be done in a different way , where people can be able to use raw materials elsewhere .
many websites and summer networks join one .
social news , as described above , will get the VALDAVAS to take the people .
traditional magazines will be completely , because people get info directly from the original .
everyone is a potential reporter , but the new advantages of the use of target groups will eliminate most of the mysteries .
the magazines become editors who instead , instead of communicating the news , bring together a larger picture of us .
the future news flow is personalised and it is constantly changing according to what you look at , much in the same way Last.fm is doing music today .
each form shall contain a target group .
you have control over each individual information that moves towards you .
two new contraceptives will start in 2010 .
one of them is an interior info , where information flows can involve parts of various sources of news , not just in plain data , but by bringing it together , sharing it by dividing them and highlighting valuable parts .
instead of reading the five different articles that are written on the same subject , you will be given one , highlighting important interest points .
how secure are your Christmas lights ?
the EL-EU tests show the perks of the electric shock of the flooding and fire control .
stay safe , splinter them out when the house of the nearest bed or lightning .
the market investigation carried out by the Commission has shown that the compact of the Christmas fire tested every third week had a risk of fire or electric shock .
tests via the Sakharov , Hungary , the Netherlands , Sloveenias and Slovaks and Slovaks in all the price categories .
samples were inspected over more than 20 requirements and many of them were through more than one test .
the Commission found a high level of wiring , weak management and poor isolation on many flags .
only more than 40 % of the samples were prepared in China .
in Hungary , almost 96 % of the lamps are dangerous .
in the Netherlands , 56 % of the EU security standards did not respond .
although only five countries took part in the study , it is likely that the light lights are sold across the EU .
Commissioner for Consumer Protection Maglena Kuneva said that the results were to be waived .
he strongly advised the EU Member States to work better on security requirements and said that unemployment ( producers , sellers , heals and importers ) should also make control more effective .
in the case of customers , he stressed vigilance , offering the following advice :
it is expected that the Stockholm commits some 4 000 participants from 1 500-1 organisation in which the EU &apos;s efforts to make development more effective are being presented .
&amp; quot ; Citizens and development &amp; quot ; under the &amp; quot ; Citizens &amp; quot ; focus will focus on the impact of this year on the impact on the economic downturn of globaal warming and poor countries .
although they are usually the last ones to blame , they are particularly affected by the economic downturn and climate change .
the truth of the sea level , desertification and increased frequency and the more serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and unexpected development goals in the thousands of years .
and the current economic climate has led to the reduction of assisting donations for developing countries , reducing food guarantors in the most vulnerable areas .
bringing together politicians , public authorities , NGOs , business leaders , academics , researchers and media , offer the European Arengement Day to establish relations , sharing experiences and to find new partners for development projects .
the three days of the Middle East , which starts by 22 October , includes training , discussion sessions and workshops .
&amp; quot ; The arsenal &amp; quot ; provides organisations with the opportunity to introduce themselves to delegates and public disclosure and to increase awareness of their objectives .
a series of developments related to development , including the Lorenzo Natali Prize for Human Rights , will be shared with a number of developments in the development of human rights , democracy and development .
the youth development premium goes for teenagers or videos , showing human development in Africa .
in October , the EU will also make the first European progress report on the fence .
this will constitute a discussion of the place of dispatch to the EU approach towards the African countries of the EU .
El gives more than half of the development aid .
the converter of Abianders will send strong signals to support Georgia .
until late time , Georgias was the fastest economy in the world - 12 % growth in 2007 .
it was a change in the shortage of Russia in a short , but short confessor .
key transport lines and utilities were damaged , frightened , and houses turned into stone clicks and poms destroyed large forests .
more than two months later , many foreign investors have left , tourists have disappeared , unemployment has been proven and many georgians have emptied their banks .
the Maailmapana is now predicting that Georgia , the power of energy sources Europe needs EUR 2.4 billion for recovery .
over the next three years the EU has committed EUR 500 million and the US has promised EUR 757 million ( 1 billion dollars ) , over half of this year .
the El and Maailmapank have taken a conference of donors on 22 October to meet the remaining EUR 1.1 billion .
it was called 70 countries and institutes .
the aid will support the overnight works and help the Government of Georgia to satisfy the first needs of those people who are dropping their homes .
tens of thousands of people were resettled , many of them still brainstormed in brain tits .
but the longer-term objective is to rebuild the economy of Georgia , which has carried out major changes in the last years .
&amp; quot ; It is important that the crisis does not lead to Georgiia &apos;s political and economic reform , which is now more important than the summer of the confessor , Benita Ferrero-Waldner .
the former Council of Soviets will normally receive around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union .
between Georgia and Russia , there is disagreement about the Lap-Ossetia and Abkasia - two left of Georgia &apos;s province , which Russia recognises as self-state .
the two sides of the Genevas will have to go on 15 October and will continue in November in November , under the auspices of the UN and the European Mediators .
this enabled the EU &apos;s Observers to move to the ceasefire to monitor the ceasefire .
thousands of Russian soldiers have left the separatists .

fourteen films , which have partly supported the EU ’ s mediadian programme , have been selected in 61 international film festivals .
the Filmifestivals are no longer financed by the EU , and millions of people have seen millions of people .

however , Europe &apos;s filmmakers are confronted with major calls both internationally and at home .
in the 19th May , the Sixth European Day in Cannes , representatives of the EU are sitting together with the European film ministers and with the European film ministers , to discuss how the audiovisual industry is to be able to engage in greater international cooperation .
the aim is to expand content circulating in other parts of the world and to cooperate more closely with other films outside the EU .
this international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films .
the Cannes festival of the previous year contained some of the films financed by the EU-Media Media Programme .
and in the beginning of this year , many of the EU ’ s Films ( e.g. The Counterfeiters and La Môme ) were presented to the Oscarians .
fourteen films financed by the EU-funded film Cannes 2008 were : Gomorra , Delta , La frontière de l &apos;Aube , Le silence de Lorna , The Palermo Shooting , The Palermo , Eldorado de Dieu lizzre , Salamandra , Les frontière , The Palermo Shooting , The Palermo , El@@
in the EU-China Summit on 20 May , in Prague , the climate change , financial crises and economic attitudes .
El and China signed agreements to expand cooperation with knowledge and technology , clean energy and small business .
again , they reaffirmed their dedication to the project to develop technology to produce electricity from the coal to the CO2 unbundling , which is the root of the globacial warming .
two sides discussed the debate on international climate change debate in Kopenhaagent .
El recommends that the economy , such as China , severely restricts the CO2 issue by offering financial support from the developed countries .
with regard to the financial crisis , the EU and China agreed that the international institutions should play a greater role in monitoring economic rises and the emergence of more pronounced and arthritive economies in these institutions .
on top of the top level negotiations , two sides stressed trade and investment as keys to economic recovery .
two sides also discussed the human rights situation in Tibet and the Sri Lankal , Afganistanis and Pakistan - three countries where China has a significant impact .
on Tuesday 15 December , the Prime Minister , Valdis Dombrovsky , received a letter of compassion to the Prime Minister of Eesti Ansipile , by expressing an acknowledgement of Eesti to the people of Eesti and the Prime Minister in an Afghan war .
in his compassion , the Prime Minister stressed that the death of a warrior was a major loss for the victim &apos;s family and all Estonia .
today , Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis and Minister for Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs , Mr Dūklavs , were held by the Minister of Agriculture , Mr Leedu , Mr Seedler , Mr Seedon Starkevičius , and Mr Valgeon Shapiroga , Minister of Agriculture and Food Minister , to discuss the future of agricultural cooperation .
Mr Jānis Dūklavs announced a four-country memorial , signed today and creating better conditions for cooperation between these countries in agriculture .
it is based on equality and mutual benefits , harmonising legislation and by changing information and practicing practical projects .
the Prime Minister stressed : &amp; quot ; Memorandum , which today has been signed , promotes cooperation with all four economies in a very important area of activity .
Mr Semyon , Minister for Agriculture and Food , thanked Latvia for the initiative of Mr Jāklav , the initiative of Mr Dūklav , which went out on his visit to Minsk to bring together the ministers of the three Baltic States and the White House , not just to discuss the problems and the current events in this field .
the Minister for Agriculture and Food in Valgesia noted that Valgeven had a wide-ranging practical experience in the production of agricultural machines and that the country would be interested in creating joint undertakings with Latvia .
the Minister Shapiro &apos;s Vote to help Latvia and the other Baltic States to provide practical experience in certification of companies producing agricultural products and agricultural machinery in order to ensure the sales opportunities for agricultural products in the EU market .
the Minister for Agriculture , Kazys Starkevičius , expressed his admiration for the active mutual cooperation in agriculture and fisheries in the European Union between three Baltic States , Soome and Poland , but a new model of cooperation between the three Baltic States and Valgeist .
the Minister for Agriculture Helir - Valdor Seeder stressed that Latvia is currently active in the field of agricultural activity with a probability to grow .
the Minister also announced that there were three main priorities in the budget for the next year , one of which is agriculture .
on Thursday , 9th December , Bonnin , Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis became a private private enterprise for promoting private enterprise policy in Europe .
the prize was awarded by Mr Jungen , President of the SMA Union , who stressed that the main objective of the prize was to shape the EU &apos;s policy towards the SMA .
the Prime Minister of Latvia thanked the SMA Union for the recognition of the recognition and the contribution made to the development of an efficient business environment in Europe .
V. Dombrovskis stressed that the SMA Union network has contributed to the idea that , in Latvia , microeconomic support measures were to be implemented .
the government has taken steps not only to ensure a fiscal sustainability , but has also developed a support programme for the micro-economic economy aimed at reducing barriers to micro-economic activity and encouraging unemployed people to start their business .
in order to achieve the objective , the government has taken a decision to reduce the company ’ s free capital requirements and registration costs , simplified tax information and accounting processes and ensure financial support for micro-economic operations .
in its speech , the Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are a driving force in the economy , contributing to the reduction of unemployment , long-term development and stability .
we have already announced that , on the dates of 8-10 December , the Prime Minister will attend Mr Valdis Dombrovskis , Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis , at the Congress of the European People &apos;s Party , Germany .
the reform group of reforms has agreed to the exchange of information , which is already signed on Monday 2 November .
the exchange of information corresponds to the model of cooperation established by the government and non-governmental bodies representing the joint responsibility for social economic situation in the country , Latvia and their impact on future developments .
the reform group has set priorities for these challenges , focusing directly on the competitiveness , growth and recovery of the country &apos;s economy .
the group stresses that the assessment of the key functions that will be carried out , which will be carried out and the rational use of potential sources of public budgets has made progress in determining the reduction of funding in accordance with the performance of tasks and the assessment of functions aimed at ending the reduction of the linear financing .
although agreement was reached on objectives - small and effective administration , expansion of internal and external markets in Latvia and promoting employment - shared the general opinion of the Group on the need to continue to work towards a clearer framework for the future structural reforms .
the Reformiadministration Group believes that it is necessary to continue the active enforcement of social security measures , measures which are included in economic recovery plans aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and encouraging investment , measures to support the launch of micro-economic activities and to support the launch of the business .
the Reformiadministration Group has agreed to make the EU ’ s programmes more rapid , which has been delayed during the current period of five years , and the group will also consider that the average budget should be implemented by allocating the budget to the operational and development budget by linking the external market to future development priorities .
the Reformiadministration Group was hoped in July 2009 with a view to ensuring a public participation in the budget reduction and decision-making .
on 26 and 27 November , the National Convergence Report in Riga on the International Congress in the European Union was held .
Latvia and Eesti agree on the merits of the territory of the territory of the territory of Egiptus in the Republic of Arabia .
from 1 January 2010 , work in Latvia and Eesti , together with rented complications in the Egiptus Republican Republic , the optiers of their administrative costs .
this agreement was reached between the Minister of Foreign Affairs Maris Riekstins and Eesti Paeti Paet in the course of his official visit to the country on 18 February this year , and ended with the following speakers .
this initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Baltic States in the Baltic Minister of Ministers in the light of the Presidency of the Council of Latvia in 2010 that similar projects will be taken in the future .
the Embassy of Latvia has acted since 2007 , which was officially opened in March 2009 during the visit of the foreign minister Maris Riekstins to Egiptus .
as from 2010 , Egiptus will start work in premises which have been rented together with Latvia .
Latvia is represented by Mr Egiptus in the Republic of Arabia .
Mr Maris Riekstins , Minister of Foreign Affairs of Maris Riekström , to find a swift solution to the situation of freight carriers at the border of Latvia .
on Tuesday , the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted a report on the progress made between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers .
both foreign ministers share the view that the situation of mutual relations in this year can generally be assessed positively .
the ministers were looking over the agenda for the next year of Latvia &apos;s relations , including further improvements in legal frameworks , such as several important agreements between several governments , for signature .
Ministers Riekstins and Lavrov also discussed the current situation concerning freight transport , Latvia and the Russian border .
as a result of the increased customs control of Russian Föderisation , the situation in Latvia is a dramatic and constraint on the long transport truck from Latvia , as it causes significant losses , a record of the foreign minister Riekstins .
the ministers agreed that the respective institutions of both countries , including the Association of Road Transport Assvijas Auto , should continue to pursue efforts in order to normalise the situation in the future , according to the agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Panel on Transport on 18 December .

lockdown Miss Coling :
my name is Susan Harris , and I &apos;m writing for Lockwood High School .
we would like to invite you to attend a special crime that will take place in our code .
your arrival would honor us .
please respond to the first day , 26 February , to confirm your presence .
we hope to see you here ,
sire , Susan Harris .
in 2007 , the most powerful particle accelerator , CERNN , is the new Large Hadron Collider , measured in the field of energy , which was only moments after Suurk Pauku .
by letting the particles collide when they move close to the speed of light , the scientists expect to find information on the historical forms of the matter , using the energy released in the collapse .
what is it expected of this large investment that Europe has done to produce LHC ?
it will send two proton speeds , particles , which are jammed into the aatomic family , which belong to the families of the particles , in different directions along the lines of 27 km , which are located under Switzerland and France .
in order to speed up the protons and to ensure that they are closed to the heel , strong magnetic fields are required , these fields are produced by the superconductors , materials which are capable of generating electricity without barriers or energy loss and which are produced in cooperation with European industry .
the proton collision is going on at a speed of two-asthathax million times in a toolbox of energy wholesale .
in order to understand the magnitude of the magnitude of this , 1 TEV is about this energy wholesale , which is useful for moving to the modest savings .
but in the LHC , it will be assembled by a million times less than a little less than this bug .
as energy can be transferred to particles in accordance with the limited relativity of the mass of mass energy , ( E = mc2 ) , physics are expected to create a particle that has never been viewed in the accelerators before .
the frequency and intensifiance of the pigeons is important because they make it possible to see the particles of particles more visible .
there are two main nuclear speeds , which energy candles 1 150 to Tev , but a lot of collisions .
for the super-symmetry ...
certain anchors are capable of analysing a collapse .
the two names are CMS ( Compact Muon Solenoid ) and Atlas ( A Toroidal LHC Apparatus ) .
they &apos;re concentrating on super symmetrical particles and Higgs bosonite .
what &apos;s super symmetry ?
particle physics contains several symmetries , such as matter and antimatter .
Supersymmetry binds fermion ( the starter to the matter for the matter , such as electricity and varnishes ) every boswith ( channelling the transfer , such as foil ) and reverse .
the invitation is that the superintendent supersymmetry ( also determined ) has never been seen before .
how do you get them ?
paradoxically , through their absence !
&quot; it &apos;s a little like being a movie .
you &apos;re counting on the number of people entering the incoming and the lightning .
if any person has disappeared at the end of this , because you know who entered , he can guess who did not . ”
in the same way , the LHC examiners are aware that the results of certain colours should arise from the antiques that are invisible to all anidurs .
knowing the energy of particles before the collapse , they shall compare the energy of the particles after the collapse .
if there are differences in energy , a part has been affected .
by calculating the missing energy , they will know whether the compass of supersymmetry or antiques is involved .
the second invitation of the CMS and the LHS anchors is the answering of Higgs bosonite .
as regards the focus of the standard model theory , it is expected that it should be interface with particles and give them masses .
how ?
let &apos;s assume there &apos;s a towels of physics .
suddenly , Albert Einstein , the stubborn , is going to take him around , and he &apos;s going to give her questions .
when Albert is trying to move , he feels certain inerts because of his cold cloth .
he &apos;s a snitch to those particles when Higgs bosonons try to have a reciprocal effect on them - they collect masses .
here too , their famous bosonite ailment can only be indirect : the particles that result in their lamination , they are what is being discovered .
Kvargi-gluoni soup
the third carrier which LHC is equipped with is called Alice ( a large ion chip experiment ) .
it is intended to detect unfamiliar nuclear physics , especially in the matter of matter , which existed in a very short period of time after Suurk Pauku , and what known as the state of the galaxy .
what &apos;s the new speciality ?
in the 1960s , the scientists , the protons and the neutralized , which formed an aatomic core , were made even more of the indigenous particles .
these windows are strong forces ( which are channelled by the parts with the names of the gluonons ) .
for their one , it is that they are diverse together : they are always either in pairs or tribes ; they cannot be extinct .
the more you try to isolate Kvark from the other kick-off , the bigger the rivers that keep them together , the alalally unseparable .
they say they &apos;re in prison .
however , if protons are to be banned against each other , the soup and the soup containing the gluons will be created , which can be free to move .
then we can get to the clearing of the knuckle gluon soup .
what kind of release ?
&amp; quot ; This is a paperwork comparable to the ski .
if there &apos;s not much fly , the tracks can be separated by grass and ski slaves are limited to their path .
from the other side , if there &apos;s a lot of flying , they can change the path .
they are free from restrictions . &amp; quot ;
instead of the snow , physics include energy : what the higher energy is , the weaker of the power , so it can be separated at a high level of energy .
the plasma presence of Kvargi-gluon was likely to be a matter of mamatter after Suurk Pauku .
it &apos;s a reason why physics want to study the iionic irons created by the LHC .
they &apos;re very rich in proton and neutron .
they can achieve energy 1 150 TEV , which is necessary for the plasma , which was unprecedented in the original shape of Universum , to create and investigate .
antimatter mystery
finally , the last anchor named LHCb ( a large Hadron accelerator ) .
its task is to better monitor the small differences between the matter and the antimatter of matter so that it can be better understood what happened to the antimatter of the universe .
for each particle , the antidote is the same as the same masses , but the counterpart .
for this reason , there is a negative mass of electricity available for electricity , but the antiElectron ( or positioning ) of the positive charge ( or positioning ) .
when the electricity and antielectron get together , they &apos;re going to be devastating from each other , for me .
according to the standard model of the particle physics , the universe was expected to be equal to the matter and antimatter .
after all , all units should destroy each other and the universe should be empty .
however , as anyone can see , the matter is rotten .
this is a place where the question of what LHCb is trying to answer : where is antimatter ?
one possible response is based on the ability of certain particles to alter themselves as their counterparts and counterparts .
in this case , the presence of the matter depends on the hypothesis ( which is expected to demonstrate ) that the conversion of antiparticles into particles is dependent on the opposite transformation of the universe .
can this imbalance be demonstrated ?
this is actually an experimental viewpoint with a particle type , which will be called for the onboard .
the Anticaons are transformed into a springon , but the opposite is much less frequent .
LHCb is investigating another candidate , B beekeeper , containing ( among other things ) an element ( or an antique ) which is called a B quake or a cunning ( where is the LCHB ) .
although the particle can &apos;t be seen , it &apos;s possible .
for this purpose , LHC has been equipped with a device containing several concentric tricks ( such as onion ) , which speaks of a particle speed where the collapse occurs .
every layer specializes in finding a certain type of thing .
the anchor &apos;s center has a chamber , inside the chamber , there are millions of drivers that produce power pulse when a part goes against .
these impulsions are converted by computers .
there &apos;s a magnet in every anchor .
this will help to detect and investigate the trajectories of the loaded particles ( e.g. electricity or proton ) which are sensitive to the magnetic field .
second , the calorific device is a calorific device .
some calories stop such particles , such as photons or electrons , but others are designed to stop neutrons and photons .
they measure the energy loss of the particles .
aid from string
how to define the nature of algosakestes separated from mechanisms that lead to their creation ?
in addition to the standard model of particle physics ( which is the result of the postulatuans of the quailman ) , today &apos;s science has concentrated its hopes entirely on a new common concept that would offer a high level of mathematical string theory .
it extends the outlook to making a completely new type of experimentesy in CERN .
the standard models ( the cornerstone of the complex physics used in the 20th century ) must be the main element of the basic component , driven by a known basic interaction between the three particles and the strong and weak river .
it will allow us to provide descriptions that fit very well with what is going on in this endlessly small world .
however , it does not take into account the four interactions - gravity .
now , physics , when the protein presents itself with a particle , phobia , by means of gravity , the gravity effect must be transferred to another particle , graviton .
the focus of harmonisation
this is why there is an obstacle ( see boxing ) on the basis of this standard model .
in addition , the Universe was such that the Universe was very small as well as exonerous ( all energy and matter concentrated in a very small area ) .
by exposing the theory to a particle that previously domiciled during this period , gravity cannot be left aside .
so how do you connect all of this to the general relativity theory ( Einstein in the original sausages ) , which turns completely around gravity ?
&amp; quot ; From the harmonisation and general relativity theory of Kvania , the physical Grail of physics has become the real Grail .
the people of scientists are working on this problem .
the most promising way seems to be a string theory . &amp; quot ;
points of point
what does this theory tell us about the world ?
firstly , this particle is viewed not as a bunker , but if the elements that can be compared with the extremely small string , which are a 10-35 metres , are the one that is in the middle of the 10th , the first one is half of the copper .
these strings vibrating and the nature of their vibrations match the different types of the particles .
the more string vibrates , the greater the power of the respective particles .
for one string theory , which is necessary for this matetic integrity , supersymmetry .
in order to understand what it is , a brief description of the basic particles &apos; zoology is necessary .
Kvantkehad in the universe can be divided into two families : there are fermions where electrolytes and varnishes are included on the other side of the bosonite family , which includes the functionality of the functionality of the EMN and the graviton ( mention above ) .
Supersymmetry
supersymmetry is the premise that each part of the family of fermion corresponds to a part of the boson family and counterside , so symmetry .
the Supersymmetic part hasn &apos;t yet been displayed , but physicists are hoping for them with a high energy collision , which they are hoping for , using LHC , the new CERNN particle accelerator .
alternatively , astronomers may indirectly monitor the effects of mysterious particles , because the total mass of galaxy and galaxies appears to be much higher than the luminous mass ( letters , gays , etc . ) which are astronomers .
they therefore possess an invisible pattern of massage , which is a reciprocal matter only through this gravity , and contains very stable , so also very small particles .
there are a number of key features that the most spiritual supersymmetry share .
they may therefore be unfamiliar with the composition of the masses , the phenomenon which was initially investigated by the Fritz Zwicky Zwicky in 1933 .
four opposite interactions with one single interaction
the second question , which is problematic for scientists , concerns the four-month nature of nature .
why are their strengths so different from each other ?
for example , the strength of gravity reciprocity is much weaker than the electromagnetic interaction .
it is proof that the magnet magnet is enough to have a high level of metallic mass , while the gravity of the gravity is needed to move the same mass .
one question that this question is is that all the fundamental interfaces are only one of the extremely high energy wholesale , which began to fall in the beginning of the Universe .
