The purpose of this report is to provide a description of how the function of human resources management should be established – to clarify the PH strategy and the operations.
Currently, the investment compartment does not have a Ph-function.
The idea of this report was designed in the debate on 22 September in the EUPCU leader Dace Roz.
However, the contents of the PHU were also discussed with other entities: Anita Bisofa, Valda Ceputers and Valdis Bissel.
The Moe Investment Department is growing rapidly and is facing many changes over the coming years.
Possible changes in the organisation of the department are already under consideration.
The pressure to deal efficiently and correctly with the work processes as well as staff matters is intrinsic.
In the current situation, directors and Heads of Unit are so busy with projects so that it is not just time to develop the PH.
It is highly desirable to appoint a person responsible for the "PH" option to focus on the establishment of a system of staff management and be able to develop it in accordance with practical needs.
Before planning an investment department, the department's vision and mission must be clear.
The strategy for the Investment Division and the short-term action plan shall be reviewed once a year.
The participation of the EU, but also in national programmes, should be highlighted according to the actual need.
The number of projects will increase significantly and more and more projects will reach an operational phase that affects the number of necessary staff and their areas of competence.
The PRK will soon be ready (manual of implementation of the project) and the PKJ (project management manual).
They should be able to use them this autumn.
The PRK shall take into account the requirements of each financing method and describe the appropriate sub-processes.
These guidelines provide practical indicators for both the workflow and the organisation.
These guidelines should serve as a basis for the following steps, such as the writing and the identification of the areas of competence.
The measures necessary for the establishment of the staff management system and in the development of a future practical need shall be described in Annex III.
The initial scheme for the establishment of the PHS is set out in Annex IV.
The plan would be the assumption that the staff manager / coordinator will be able to work full-time work at the beginning of December 2003.
The Director of the Department and the Heads of Unit should cooperate closely with staff management staff — to inform him of the needs of the continuous development and to place it at the forefront.
They will also be responsible for the evaluation and the scoreboard for the development of development; the staff management staff member will contribute to the discussion of the modernisation of chess and data files.
The Heads of Unit must also play an active role in developing areas of competence and content.
All personnel are involved in the self-assessment of competences.
Staff management staff shall coordinate the evaluation of competences and manage the data files.
The budget of the Section for the financial year 2004 must cover both "PH" development costs (mainly the cost of salaries, the cost of salaries of units, IT staff, IT staff) and the cost of training.
The implementation costs consist of direct costs (e.g. courses, lecturers, materials), teaching and training time, training of participants in training and training and facilitation of training by the PH-employee.
Once a year, the cost of lost time will also result in cost assessments and PLP conversations.
Before the offer of any budget is offered, an approximate assessment of the training activities in 2004 must be carried out.

In view of the call for the March 2005 Council of March 2005, Latvia has prepared a national Lisbon programme for the years 2005-2008 (the "programme"), with a view to promoting economic growth and employment in the country.
The programme is a policy planning instrument, which shows how Latvia will achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for the period 2005-2008, following the integrated guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005.
The programme reflects the key challenges of Latvia to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and will show the main features of actions and actions to address these challenges, as well as performance indicators for achieving these objectives.
The programme shall be based on the planning documents of the approved policy of the Republic of Latvia.
The development of the programme helped coordinate the Lisbon Strategy.
The consultation was held with the Latvian Parliament and the social partners.
The programme consists of an introduction, a key part (macroeconomic policy, microeconomic reforms, guidelines for employment policy) and the annexes.
All available information and figures were obtained from the Latvian Statistical Office or Eurostat, with the exception of those specifically indicated.
In order to achieve the success of these objectives, Ministries to develop strategic plans for the preparation of the 2007 budget should be prepared on the basis of strategic planning principles, in line with the priorities set by the government in the institutions' strategy for the medium-term development objectives and direction, but also all the relevant ministries, programmes and sub-programmes relating to these objectives and guidelines, including their funding.
To ensure that Latvia is successful in joining the euro area,
The Council of Ministers adopted a decision on 21 July 2005 to set up a joint European currency in Latvia to establish a plan to develop the necessary measures to ensure Latvia ’ s successful accession to the euro area.
On 31 December 2004, public debt amounted to 975 million to 13,3% of GDP.
It is expected that public debt is expected to increase further in the coming years and may reach 13.6% of GDP in 2008.
Latvia ’ s public debt is one of the lowest in the European Union and it is expected that it will considerably lower the national gross debt criterion (60% of GDP), as defined in the Maastricht Treaty.
On the basis of the information provided, in the current situation of Latvia, the urgent need to develop a specific plan to reduce public debt, but before any action in the area of public debt management needs to be carefully analysed in order to ensure the most favourable transaction for the State.
The main measures proposed in the field of sovereign debt for the period 2005-2008 (Guideline 2).
To ensure the necessary resources to finance the government deficit and to refinance public debt obligations at the lowest possible and favourable conditions, by limiting the financial risks and taking into account the evolution of the capital market in Latvia and all financial systems (responsible authority: Ministry of Finance):
– to develop new debt repurchase and debt exchange programmes to manage debt refinancing risk, with a view to the use of the opportunities offered by the capital market to attract long-term resources at low cost;
- Following the reduction already started in the public debt service costs, all existing provisions in the field of external credit agreements will be reviewed to assess the future of several loans in the future by refinancing these loans with other more favourable loans, or a possible loan contract provisions. the possibilities of amending and existing restrictions.
The sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed positively and is characterised by relatively low public debt, but also adequate budgetary discipline.
Latvia's commitment to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as with the aim of meeting the euro area, is one of the additional positive trends in the current budgetary position.
The long-term horizon has an impact on the sustainability of public finances, mainly by the ageing population, leading to a shrinking of the population and their share of the population and increasing the demographic burden.
The preliminary calculations of fiscal sustainability show that the ageing of the population is affecting the Latvian society and the public economy and monetary finances, but this effect does not result in unsurmountable consequences.
Latvia ’ s low public debt and the pressures of increasing costs will give the government a degree of flexibility and maintain the stability of public finances.
It should be noted, however, that an ageing population has a new approach to the health care system.
The distribution of health costs by age groups clearly shows that higher costs are lower for older people, with a significant increase in the number of older people over the next 50 years.
Long-term care costs are currently relatively small in Latvia, which is due to the limited resources of both the state and local authorities, but also of the traditions and values of society.
At the same time, the health of other demographic groups must also be ensured, since the overall level of morbidity is high.
The government is developing an effective health care system based on a long-term perspective.
In order to adapt significantly to the current demographic situation, it is necessary to make changes in public finances in the future.
As demographic pressure increases in the long term, the increase in the living standards of all population groups will play a decisive role in the increased productivity growth based on labour productivity growth.
It is therefore important to ensure Latvia ’ s main wealth of wealth, in line with the requirements of the labour market, in order to create an accessible labour market for all (see section 3).
It also makes a significant contribution to the overall development of the Latvian economy as it meets the requirements of wood processing, the raw material for one of the largest exports of the Latvian industry.
The forest is also an important resource for rural development, since it provides a livelihood for residents working in local regions, 150 000 forest owners and businesses involved in forestry.
Part of the revenue generated by the end and use or services will be invested in the forest owner to maintain the value of the forest or to introduce continuous production.
The largest forest owners (country, local authorities and some private forestry companies with thousands of hectares of forest areas) can ensure a continuous production process throughout the long forest management cycle.
Taking into account the composition, age, structure, previous administrative practice of the tree species, the economic situation of the rural area, but also the knowledge of forest owners, the continued use of forest production in small forest owners is significantly hampered.
Due to the above circumstances, there is currently insufficient investment in the restoration of forest value in the private sector (revenues); it is therefore necessary to promote bottom-up productivity (timely and high quality renewal of forest, use of selected forest reproductive material in the forest for renewal of the forest)., the cultivation of young trees, in particular in specialised agencies.
While Latvia's waste management systems have been complemented and the awareness of society's awareness of the need to reduce landfill has increased, the amount of garbage generated is growing every year.
The possibilities for the processing and utilisation of the waste are insufficient, although companies receive subsidies for the collection and utilisation of waste from environmentally harmful goods and products from the Latvian environmental protection funds.
Water management infrastructures (water supply and waste water collection and treatment) are insufficiently developed and obsolete, its capacity is not economically justified, the technologies used are energy costly and does not meet all environmental requirements.
This limits the development of the activity, in particular in remote regions of the country.
Access to water management infrastructure is strongly influenced by the development of utilities, public health, health and tourism industries.
Latvia needs to determine the time limit for transposition of the internal market rules, but also to ensure the coordination of national governance and trans-national transposition of directives at the political level.
As of 7 September 2005, Latvia had not notified 1,3% of the transposition of EU directives (or 0.5% of the total number of directives).
Given that 99,5% of the Directives had been transposed into Latvian norms as of 7 September 2005, it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective – at least 98,5% of the directives, or a maximum of 1.5% of the transposition deficit k.
The transposition of internal market directives and the implementation of the relevant legislation directly depends on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation.
At present, there is no effective, comprehensive database for monitoring transposition of EU legislation, which would allow the monitoring of the transposition process in several reference points within a set of reference points, and thus – in addition to other factors – slows down the transposition process of directives and the EU internal market the creation of a vibration is hampered.
The scarce staff of public administrations will reduce their capacity to ensure a qualitative and timely compliance with the Latvian legal system of the transposition process of the EU directives.
The restrictions on the freedoms of the EU's internal market were lost in most of the most deprived before Latvia's accession to the EU, but there are barriers to existing transactions.
Important obstacles stem from existing authorisation requirements and time-consuming administrative procedures requiring additional money and time for economic operators and are the worst affected to small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is therefore necessary to analyse the validity of the existing various licensing and other restraints with the requirements of the EU, including free professions (lawyers, notaries, accountants, architects, engineers and pharmacists). the requirements and validity of restrictions to enhance competitiveness in these sectors.
For the introduction of a harmonised and harmonised competition policy, the harmonisation of the standard of competition in Latvia in 2004, in accordance with the requirements of EU competition standards, is harmonised.
In order to prevent obstacles to cross border competition or to prevent potential distortions of competition, the Latvian Competition Authority (RCC) started to cooperate with the European Commission and the ECI Member States' competition authorities.
The electricity market is gradually opening.
As of 1 July 2004, for legal entities, a qualified free consumer status threshold for legal persons was set at 0.0 GWh.
Therefore, only domestic suppliers can choose to choose the supplier, and the opening of the electricity market is guaranteed up to 75%.
Until now, none of the free customers have switched the electricity supplier.
In order to stimulate competition and encourage the market entry of alternative suppliers, the functionality and distribution functions of electricity are legally and functionally separated from the functionalities of the generation and sale of electricity.
The conditions of electricity supply structures are defined in the electricity market law.

In addition, the Treaty provisions allow every European citizen to monitor Parliament's work, ask questions and receive answers in their own language.

With the joint declaration, the EU institutions have undertaken to resolve problems with the Member States in the area of communiquation of EU issues in order to ensure communication at the level of the highest possible target group.
In this context, they expressed their willingness to develop synergies with national, regional and local authorities and civil society representatives.
While each Member State and each institution has its own communication strategy and its priorities, Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed to establish a small number of common communication priorities for each year together.
In addition, the Commission will be invited to provide feedback to the other EU institutions at the beginning of each year on the most important achievements in implementing the common communication priorities for the previous year.

The access code shall be unique and shall be set up for a specific coding calculator, date, time and mode of use.
The number of access codes is unlimited.
Each access code can only be made by one operation.
The calculator (s) is (see picture) of the calculator (s).
2. (2) is the tip of the calculator on the calculator.
If the coding calculator is not switched off, the coding calculator shall automatically be switched off for a period of time.
It is therefore recommended that the new access code be increased immediately prior to its use.
If the access codes are repeatedly increased, but not used (enter), the codilator is blocked.
For the reactivation of the assembly calculator, the Krajbanka information telephone must be called + 371 67092020.
The customer will then inform the bank of his username, password and code-calculator code.

The cod card is a plastic card, which contains 35 disposable code numbers under a ditch.
The cod card is one of the security tools that can be used by the Krājbanka electronic settlement systems – an online bank, telephone bank and mobile bank.
The code number is a numbering combination of the card in the right of the map.
When using an electronic clearing system, this number shall be included in a personal interview.
The code code is a six-digit code used for the verification of the transaction in an electronic settlement system.
In the interests of convenience, several transactions can be confirmed simultaneously with one code.
We ask that the cod card is valid until the last code is used.
In order to ensure that your constant access to the electronic settlement systems is guaranteed, we are asking for a new code card from some of the new Krājbanka customer service.

"To open a door, gently pull the handle out of hand."
He wasn't his father's only son, even though he was the oldest of brothers, his brother William made his business in Cuckold's Cloud and the greenhouse gas... he had three sisters, all in a favourable marriage with freshmen.
The bodies of the organs were found in several places in the city, but the Richard clan, who had been oppressed in the past, had already lived in Wales, and had already lived enough for generations to achieve a certain position; the more enlightened members of the clan such as nephew of nephew James owned, belonged to merchants and a corporation, made pneumatic donations to the orphans and spoiled them. hope never to be mayor.
Richard's father wasn't one of them, but he didn't have any reason to feel a shame.
After a short study in primary school, he went to work with a diner, and later, with a professional certificate, a free man who paid his fines, he tried to pursue the deputies of the deputer.
He was also organised as a conspicuous marriage; Margaret Biggs was from a wealthy farm from the sources of farmers from Bedminster, and brought about an incapacity to read the reading skills, although he did not understand.
Children, the first girl, came to the weather with sufficient frequency so that they did not cause any intolerable pain and grief.
When Dick learned to ruin so much to pull out before dawn, the number of children left to stay with two living son and three daughters.
A real family, and a little enough to take care of the more.
Dick wanted at least one son to learn how to read and write, and his hopes focused on Richard when it was clear that two years younger, William's schoolman isn't.
So, when Richard had been seven years old, he rode to the Colston Poissor School and became a famous blue coat that declared bristolans that his father is poor but respectable, a cliff of anglicaan.
And in the next five years, he was taped full of literacy and computer skills.
He learned to write with a nice hand, calculate his mind, lousy himself through Caesar's Gallia, Cicero and Ovidius Metamorphosis, an auxiliary scumbag. and the words of the school masters are disguised.
Because he was a good student, even though it was a long way of excellence, and a courtesy of courtesy of the presence of a courtesy, he got away from the charity of Mr. Colston's charity tuition and greater use than a lot of others.
At the age of 10 years, it was time to leave the school and find a business or an invitation to a educational attainment.
However, the great surprise of relatives, however, has not chosen any of the existing activities of the organs.
His greatest forgiveness was the mechanics of the mechanics, the pieces of things, accompanied by an admirable patience for a young man.
And on his own choice, he became the apprentice of Lord Tomas in Habitas, who held an arms servant.
The father has been happy to say the peace of mind, he was reminded that one of the Morganions would grow as a handler, not a merchant.
Besides, the war was a part of life and a war needed weapons.
A man who was able to make weapons and improve his mind was not threatened by a threat to the battlefield.
For Richard, a seven-year-old apprenticeship was a happy hour of work and a learning period, even though it was slightly modest in terms of physical pleasures.
Like the other schoolboys, he was hired, lived in a host house, served him at the dinner table, filled with food on the stomach and slept on the floor.
Luckily, Lord Tomas Haitas Habitas was a good host, and even a better weapon of arms.
Although he was able to produce beautiful dummy guns and hunting rifles, he had enough to understand that Manton would have to be Manton, but Manton could not be outside London.
That's how he works for the war muskets, the soldiers of the 46-inch Bessim called "Pruit Bessien", the cuffs of wood, the cuffs, and the peanut brown brown. karva.
In nineteen years, Richard got a masterpiece and moved out of the Habitas house, but not his workshop.
That's where he continued to work on the Pruunide Besses.
And she got married, so when the apprentice of the apprentice had turned around.
He could have her mother's brother's daughter, perhaps his own cousin, but that the English church had no objection to it, he was returning to his bride at St. James's church..
The marriage was arranged, but it was in love with the love of the spouses in the years.
Although there were some confusion about the fact that Richard Morgan and Margaret Briggs' son, Richard Morgan, took her to marry Margaret Briggs.
Until the Habitas gun shop worked hard, it wasn't something weird about it because the young couple lived in a regrettable rental, Avon against Temple Street, Habitas, Habitas. you and the Jewish synagogue from the synagogue.
A marriage was signed in 1767, three years after the end of the seven-year war with France, despite the heavy peace agreement, despite the gravity of the debt, to increase taxes for England and to raise taxes, and the neglect armies of the money. and dramatically tighten up the fleet.
There is no need for weapons, so the masters and the students from one step outside Habitas, until the entire company consisted only of Richard and Lord Tomas Habitaas himself.
And then, for a while after the little Mary was born in 1770, Habitas was discouraged as he was forced to shoot Richard.
"come to work for me," Dick Morgan called.
"The Rellow will come and go, but the rum remains."
And that's what happened, no matter what.
Richard's mother was always invited briefly on Mag and Richard's wife Peg, both of Margaret.
The greater problem was, however, that all of England ’ s men - except for the descendants of the rigid protestant, who were risked to Cranfieldes and the Onesiphorus as the name of John, William, Henry, Richard, James or Thomas, all women were at the dots, Catherine, Margaret, Elizabeth, or Maryd.
It was one of the few of the practices that fit to everyone, the king.
"I see this for the first time."
It was called a caliber diver that had just given the surface of a research vessel to the surface, and he barely had a word of excitement.
After the ladder, he took the plates and the mask off, and delivered them to the farmed steak.
He then stretched himself out of a poor water by losing the balance of the cylinders for a moment, but on the other side of the aid, the whole of the aid on the deck.
In a moment, a drop of shape was surrounded by other crew members who were already waiting on the diving deck.
Jack Howard stepped down the captain and smiled a friend.
He still couldn't believe he'd be able to move so much under the water.
Back on the deck, the diving equipment in the back of the bells opened his mouth, a friend of mine in the years lovely.
"and we thought you returned to Athens and sitting in a gin and tonic in the pool of his father's pool."
The study is not based on climate-specific qualitative data, forecasts or personal opinions, but has been assembled from many sources, including interviews, arrogance, trends and figures.
All data prior to the 1990s were based on interviews and numerous online searches on newspapers, television and radio history, more specifically in search of information collection methods.
The schedules for the period after 1998 are based on everything that has taken place over the past 11 years and for which I have been reading about 1000 different studies.
The graph of 2009 and the next few years will be based on the forecasts of my people and others for the years ahead.
Graphics do not preclude the precision of a hundred percent, their aim is to provide an overview of the evolution of the situation and to outline social media news, targeted communication and other forward-looking future.
The purpose of this article is to put people in mind.
We are now seeing a whole new way of how people can communicate - one that makes the traditional ways to simple waves.
This is a fundamental change, which makes the world that we know it, completely.
The best thing about this is that you can help with it.
Come with me on tour of information sources into the last 210-year-old, plus a glimpse of the next ten years.
Before we get back to the future, let's see how we made it today, so let's start with us to go back to the 1800s where it happened differently.
In the 1800s in the 1800s, people had to go out and get together.
Everything was in touch with the face.
In order to sell the product, you should have been the only way to communicate to the local market and in general terms, it was personal or to set the sales table.
It meant that for you to obtain information or to give it to it, it had to be in the right place in the right place.
You did not know what was going on in another town, and did not have any of their products to sell to the people in another place.
They were talking about a novelty concept called a newspaper...
In 1900, the newspapers and magazines have changed communication, allowing us to have news of places where we never had.
We got our ideas to the people we never saw, and sell their products to others far away.
We were supposed to go out and talk to other people, but we could have been informed about leaving our town.
It was unbelievable, the first real information revolution.
The world began to make love to everyone.
Since 1920, a new source of information on people's attention - radio.
Suddenly, you could listen to another person's voice from hundreds of miles away.
But most importantly, the latest information was available in real time.
It was the next huge development in the history of information.
However, the time of changing the radio meant that, until 1960, our lives were dominated by the newspapers.
If you wanted to get the latest news or introduce to people your product, you would have used the newspaper.
It seemed like they were the most important source of information much longer.
This situation started to change in 1960.
The radio arrived and two main sources of information were reported in real-time news on the radio, and the more detailed news reported through newspapers and magazines.
It was a great time for the media, although some said, 'to enable the newspapers to compete with the radio, better newspapers' - the argument that we have repeatedly heard for the next 50 years.
Over the next 40 years, the following technical revolution was introduced: television.
It began to gather public interest in the 1950s and at the beginning of the 1990s, the spread of it was high, by large newspapers and magazines, while still dominated by the radio.
Now people got information to hear and look at it.
The years 1970-1990 was also the time when the newspaper publishers understood that something was horribly wrong with their sales market.
They had a lot of problems with a radio race, but television was again on the second grade.
Only eight years later and television ruled the information world, the radio had almost changed only "place from where to listen to free music" and the newspapers did everything you could to persist.
The constant development of the technology continued with the persistence that was never seen before.
The new phenomen in the spy shade: the Internet.
1998 was a year when the Internet became a strange place that was not important, undisputed, with the view that each company has to have a website.
The revolution had started three years earlier, but in 1998, it reached a critical mass and tried all the attention, despite the relatively small and most people being used to access it.
However, everyone agreed that it was the future - the beginning of the new era.
It was a place where everyone could have received information from anywhere - at least in theory.
People started to understand that the Internet was more than just information.
In the interviews of conversation, you could give back something back and be part of it instead of being just a tracker.
The most important thing was, however, that you could choose what you wanted to do and when you wanted to do so.
The Internet of the Internet was a deterrent.
In 2004, only six years later, the Internet had changed the way we had information.
Television and newspapers, however, were dominated by our news sources, but the latest world was definitely on the Internet.
People made new websites and discovered the world of online applications.
People were able to do so much and to participate in so many areas, that a new concept emerged: the override of the information.
For the first time in my life, we were in contact with more information when we were able to absorb.
In the era of newspapers, we had to choose what we wanted to see.
In 2004 we had to choose what we didn't want to see.
It had a devastating effect on the traditional shape of information.
In the past, it was possible to get people's attention simply doing something.
People wanted more choice, so they just had to give them a new option.
In 2004 this change, because it was not enough: it was supposed to be better.
2004 was also a year when another phenomenon began to emerge: communication networks.
This concept was quietly collected by blogs.
It was easy, easy and accessible to all of them to share their ideas.
For the first time, everyone had the opportunity to create their own information, without any technical experience.
The processing of information became a tool tool for all the tools.
Three years later and the social element of the Internet showed how powerful the voice of people really is.
For the first time, television was no longer the source of information and the newspapers fought for survival.
Everyone wanted to create their own little world and combine it with their friends.
2007 was also a turning point for traditional websites that people compare with newspapers - static and passive information.
We wanted an active information.
We wanted to be part of it, not only to look at it.
The blogs started to get into trouble.
As the television had removed the radio (because it was a better and richest way to provide information in the runway to people), social networking blocks were blocked.
The social profile is a more active way for people to share what they care about.
Social networks are just better and blogs can't stay on this one.
Two years later, today, the new Internet will dominate our world.
The newspapers are dead in the water, and people look less TV than ever.
We're new kings, using social networking tools to contact and communicate.
Even the traditional website will die, which has killed the unmerciless power of constant information circuits coming from social networks.
In the last 210 years, we have seen an amazing development how we can get information.
The main steps are to:
It's got information from the distant places.
Two, it's getting in real time.
It's a vision in real-time.
To decide when to look at anything and see what to look at.
Option 5 to take part and comment.
6. publication of your information.
7. source of information.
2009 is the beginning of the next revolution.
All we know is going to change.
The first and most dramatic change is the concept of social news.
It will quickly take over us to be aware of what is happening in the world.
The news will no longer be transmitted by journalists because it is now coming from everyone.
They will be sent directly from the source, leaving between traditional media channels.
Instead that the journalist will transmit what analysts say, you can hear it now from the analyst.
The social news receives news from the source directly and uncentered.
A new entertainment wave (light blue and lilage areas), dominated by games, video and sound streams are emerging.
Instead of putting on the TV channel, you decide what you want to watch and when you want to look at it.
We will no longer join the channels, where someone else decides what we can look at.
You control all the experience.
In the form of information, the new concept will emerge slowly.
We already see a growing number of mobile telephony services, which provide local information about the area in which you are located.
For example, instead of showing off all the restaurants in the world, the phone only shows the list in your region.
It's something that's going to grow in the next few years.
In the world where we have access to more information, if we can consume, it is a very important element of obtaining relevant information, so far beyond the simple location we are seeing today.
The information world will change in the next five or ten years.
All traditional forms die eventually.
The printed newspapers no longer exist, television, in the form of current channels, will be replaced by individual programmes that you can see if you want.
Radio boots are designed to replace them with pockets and videos.
Websites have a much smaller role - their primary function is to be a distributor of activities that can be done elsewhere, changing places where people can use raw materials in other places.
Many of the websites and social networking sites join one.
Social news, as described in advance, is becoming an overwhelming way of how people interact.
The traditional journalism is fully embedded, as people get the information directly from the source.
Everyone is a potential reporter, but the new advantages of using the target groups will eliminate the majority of the toxin.
Journalists will become editors who, instead of broadening the news, bring them together, giving us a bigger picture.
The future news flow is personalised, and it is constantly changing according to what you look at - in the same way that Last.fm does the music today.
Everyone contains a target group.
You have control of every single infant that moves in your direction.
Two new concepts will emerge in 2010.
One of them is intelligent information in which information flows can be included in many different sources of news, not just pulling data, but by sharing it by dividing it into parts and by issuing valuable parts.
Instead of reading five different articles from the same theme, one is proposed to give you one, highlighting the important points of interest.
How safe are your Christmas lights?
The EU tests show serious risks for the electric shock and fire integrity of floodgates.
Keep it safe. turn them off when you go to bed or get out of the house.
The market survey carried out by the Commission was brought out that each set of Christmas lights tested in each third of the three tests had a direct risk of fire safety or electric shock.
The tests were carried out in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia, with nearly 200 shepherds of all the price categories.
The samples were checked for more than 20 requests and many failed more than one test.
The Commission found a series of photoconductive, weak management and poor isolation on many sheep ’ s.
Only over 40% of the samples were made in China.
In Hungary, almost 96% of the sheep were found to be dangerous.
In the Netherlands, 56% did not meet the EU's market standards.
Although only five countries took part in the study, the same lamp is likely to be sold across the EU.
The Commissioner for Consumer Protection Maglena Kuneva said that the results were awakening.
He urged the EU Member States to work better on the enforcement of security requirements and said that industry (producers, retailers, dealers and importers) should also make controls more effective.
In the case of customers, he stressed the vigilance by providing the following advice: 1. buy Christmas lights from the merchant 2, never leave the Christmas lights when you leave home or go to bed 3. there are problems with the lights, stop using them, and return them to the store.
In the Stockholm event, some 4 000 participants are expected to take part from 1 500 organisations in which the EU ’ s efforts to make the development more efficient.
The general theme "citizens and development" focuses on the effects of global warming and the economic recession of the poorest countries in this year.
Although they are usually the ones who are accused, they are particularly affected by both economic decline and climate change.
The rise in sea level, desertification and increased, serious natural disasters can lead to millions of poverty and unprecedented development goals over the millennium.
And the current economic climate has led to a reduction in aid for developing countries by reducing food guarantees in vulnerable regions.
Bringing together politicians, national officials, NGOs, business leaders, academics, academics and media, European Development Days offer the opportunity to create relations, share experience and find new partners for development projects.
Three days of events, starting on 22 October, will include training, discussion forums and workshops.
"Development villages" offer organisations the opportunity to present themselves to delegates and to the general public and to raise awareness of their objectives.
A number of development prizes, including Lorenzo Natali, will be distributed to the outstanding presentation of human rights, democracy and development problems.
The youth development premium goes for teenagers or videos showing human development in Africa.
The EU will also publish the first European progress report on the first time.
This is the place of departure for the EU's approach towards "fragile" against sub-Saharan Africa countries.
The EU gives more than half of its total development aid.
The donors' conference sends strong signals to Georgia.
Until later, in Georgia, the fastest growing economy in Georgia in the world was 12% in 2007.
This became a short, but tense conflict with Russia in August.
The key transport lines and the utilities were damaged, buildings and houses became a stone bubble, and the bombs destroyed large forest areas.
More than two months later, many foreign investors have left, the tourists have lost, unemployment has risen, and many georgans have emptied their bank accounts.
The World Bank is now forecasting that Georgia, the energy source gate to Europe, needs EUR 2.4 billion to recover.
Over the next three years, the EU has committed €500 million, and the US has committed EUR 757 million ($1 billion), over half the end of this year.
The EU and the World Bank hosted the donors' conference on 22 October in order to meet the remaining EUR 1.1 billion.
The event was called about 70 countries and the institution.
The aid will support reconstruction and help the Georgian Government meet the first needs of these people who had to flee their homes.
Tens of thousands of people resettled, many of them will still find shelter in temporary refugee centres.
But the longer term goal is to restore the Georgia economy, which has made major changes in recent years.
"It is important that the crisis does not lead Georgia away from the political and economic reforms, which is now more important than before the conflict, the Commissioner for External Relations, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
The former Soviet Republican usually receives around EUR 40 million per year from the European Union.
There are differences between Georgia and Russia on South Ossetia and Abkhazia - two divided by the province of Georgia, which Russia recognises as an independent country.
Two sides will have the first peace talks in Geneva on 15 October and the talks will continue in November under the auspices of the United Nations and European mediators.
This allowed EU observers to move to these areas to monitor the ceasefire.
Thousands of Russian soldiers have remained on the areas of separatists.

One of the last year winners was the Finnish rock band on Sunrise Avenue, which received his "On The Way to Wonderland" album.
Mikko Saukkonen, the Battle of Bonnier Amigo, said that the prize is for a group that is currently recording the second album, attracted attention.
"We are very confident that this will help in the future of the band".
The 2008 Cannes Festival shows the success of EU-funded films in the world.
A fourteen film that has been partially supported by the EU Media Programme has been selected in 61 Cannes International Film Festival.
Film festivals no longer EU-funded production has seen millions of people in a stranger and over the years.
The EU Media Programme supports European audiovisual projects by promoting the cultural diversity of the continent through the film.
However, European film makers are confronted with major challenges both internationally and at home.
On May 19th, the sixth "European Day", in Cannes, EU representatives are seated with European film ministers and producers to discuss how to stimulate greater international cooperation in the audiovisual industry.
The aim is to extend the circulation of content to other parts of the world and to cooperate more closely with other film industries outside the EU.
Such an international partnership would contribute to the production and distribution of European films.
The choice of the Cannes Festival of the previous year included a single film financed by the EU Media Programme.
And at the beginning of this year a number of films from the EU were present (e.g. The counterfeit iters and La Môme) were presented to Oscars.
14 EU funded film Cannes 2008 Festival had: Gomorra, Delta, La frontière de l'aube, Le Silence de Lorna, The Palermo Shooting, sangue "," - "Entre," Entre broken, Tulpan, Eldorado, Elève libre, Salamandra, Les Prize de Dieu, Better things and Home Affairs.
At the EU-China Summit in Prague on 20 May, the prevailing theme was climate change, financial crisis and economic relations.
The EU and China signed agreements to extend cooperation in science and technology, clean energy and small business.
They reaffirmed their commitment to the project in order to develop the technology to produce coal from unbundling coal - one of the main gas - which is the cause of global warming.
Two sides also discussed views on the international debate on climate change in Copenhagen in December.
The EU recommends developing economies, such as China, to limit carbon emissions by offering financial support from developed countries in return.
With regard to the financial crisis, the EU and China agreed that international institutions should have a greater role in monitoring the economic risks and the emerging and emerging economies should have more say in these institutions.
In May ’ s peak negotiations, two sides of trade and investment were underlined as a key to economic recovery.
Two sides also discussed the human rights situation in Tibet and conflict in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Pakistan - three countries where China has a significant impact.
On Tuesday 15 December, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis sent a letter to the Estonian Prime Minister, Mr Andrus Ansipile, to express my condolences to the Estonian people and the Prime Minister in Afghanistan in Afghanistan dead in Afghanistan.
In my condolences, the Prime Minister stressed that the death of the soldier was a great loss to the victim's family and all Estonia.
Today, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis and Minister for Agriculture, Jānis DŪKLAVS, Estonia, Estonian Minister of Agriculture, Valdor Seederi, Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture, Kazys STARKEVIČIUS and Belarus and with the food minister, Semyon Shapiroga to discuss the future of agricultural cooperation.
The Lithuanian Minister of Agriculture, Jānis DŪKLAVS, announced four countries' Memorandum, signed today and creating better conditions for their cooperation in agriculture.
It is based on equality and mutual benefits, by harmonising legislation and exchanging information and carrying out practical projects.
The Prime Minister said: "Memorandum, which was signed today, promotes cooperation in all four economies in a very important area of activity - agriculture".
The Belarusian Minister of Agriculture and Food Semyon Shapiro thanked the Latvian Agriculture Minister, Jānis Dūklavsi, on his visit to Minsk to bring together three Baltic the Agriculture Ministers of the country and Belarus, not just to discuss problems and the current events in this area, but also put in place specific tasks that will be carried out in the future.
The Belarusian Ministry of Agriculture and Food stated that Belarus has extensive practical experience in the production of agricultural machinery and that it would be interested in the creation of joint ventures with Latvia.
Minister Shapiro called for professional farmers in the Latvian and other Baltic countries to provide practical experience in the certification of agricultural products manufacturing companies and agricultural machinery in order to guarantee the opportunities for sales of agricultural products in Belarus in the EU market.
Lithuanian Minister for Agriculture, Kazys STARKEVIČIUS, expressed their gratitude in Brussels for active mutual cooperation in agriculture and fisheries in the European Union between the three Baltic States, Finland and Poland, but today a new cooperation model was launched on three Baltic States and Belarus.
The Estonian Minister of Agriculture, Mr Valdor Seeder, stressed that Latvia is currently active in cooperation in the field of agriculture, with the likelihood of growing.
The Minister also announced that there were three main priorities for the next year's budget, one of them in agriculture.
Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, for the promotion of private enterprise policy for the political private enterprise of the European People ’ s Political Enterprise Policy.
The prize was handed over by Mr Peter Jungen, President of the Union, who pointed out that the main objective of the prize was to develop an EU policy more in a more friendly way.
The Latvian Prime Minister thanked the SME's recognition and the contribution made to the development of an investment friendly and efficient business environment in Europe.
V. Dombrovskis stressed that the SME network has contributed to the idea of introducing support for micro-economic support in Latvia.
The Latvian Government has taken steps not only to ensure fiscal sustainability but has also developed a support programme for the micro-economy of Latvia, aimed at reducing barriers to micro-economic activities and encouraging unemployed people to start their business.
In order to achieve this objective, the government has adopted a decision to reduce the company ’ s free capital requirements and the costs of registration, simplify the information and accounting procedures and have ensured financial support for micro-economic activities.
In its speech, the Prime Minister stressed that small and medium-sized enterprises are a driving force in the economy, contributing to a reduction in unemployment, long-term development and stability.
We have already announced that the 8-10 December will be attended by Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis on the Congress of the European People's Party in Bonn, Germany.
The National Enticipation Group has agreed to the interconnected information exchange, which will be signed on Monday, 2 November. exchange of information will be presented to the work of the current group and outlines the main challenges to be achieved through structural reforms.
The exchange of information corresponds to the cooperation model established by the Government and non-governmental bodies, which represent the joint responsibility for the socio-economic situation in the country, the international obligations of Latvia and their impact on future developments.
The administrative group of reforms has set priorities for these tasks, which directly focus on the competitiveness, growth and recovery of the country's economy.
The group stresses that the assessment of the interconnected core functions carried out, and the rational use of potential public budget sources, has taken place in order to determine the reduction of funding in accordance with the results of the tasks and the assessment of the functions of the functions, which are aimed at concluding linear financing. reduction.
While agreement was reached on the objectives - a small and efficient administration, the expansion of the internal and external markets for the Latvian economy and the promotion of employment - the members of the Group divided the general view of the need to continue to provide a clearer framework for structural reforms in the future.
The Reformical Group believes that it is necessary to continue to actively introduce social security measures, the measures contained in the economic recovery plans aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and attracting investment, measures for micro-economic activities and business start-ups to support the analysis of the functions of the public administration, to accelerate the evaluation methodology, and the introduction of "head and find" principle in the management of the service.
The Reformical Group has agreed to the need to accelerate the introduction of EU programmes, which have been delayed and achieved over the current period of five years. and for the development budget, linking the external market to future development priorities, an attractive investment climate to internal and external capital by reducing taxes and introducing other comparable incentives.
The Reformical Group was set up in July 2009, with a view to ensuring public participation in the reduction of the budget and decision-making.
The International Conference in the European Union was held on 26 November and 27 November at the International Conference on Undeclared partnership in the European Union.
Latvia and Estonia jointly agree to lease the territory for diplomatic representation in the Arab Republic of Egypt.
With effect from 1 January 2010, Latvia and Estonia are working together with the rented complex in the Egyptian Arab Republic, optimising their administrative costs.
The agreement was reached between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Maris Riekishsi and the Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet, on 18 February, this year, and ended with the next talks between the Foreign Ministers.
This initiative is the best example of cooperation between the Baltic States in the light of the presidency of the Baltic Council of the Baltic States, which, in the course of 2010, will take similar projects to be introduced in the future.
The Latvian embassy in Cairo has been operational since 2007, officially opened in March 2009 in March 2009 by the Foreign Minister, Maris Riekishsi, Egypt.
Since the year 2010, Estonia will start the work in Egypt on premises rented with Latvia.
Latvia is represented by Maris Selga since the Egyptian Arab Republic.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs in Maris Riekishs, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, called on to find a quick solution to the situation of freight carriers at the border of the Russian Russian border.
They also discussed the results of national relations with the Russian Federation of Foreign Affairs in Maris Riekishsi and the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation of Foreign Affairs, both sides in 2009, as well as current developments in the situation of freight carriers in Latvia. - On the Russian border.
Both foreign ministers shared the view that the situation of reciprocal relations in this year can generally be assessed positively.
Next, ministers reviewed the agenda for the coming year in Russia, including further improvements in the legal framework, e.g. several important agreements between several governments are prepared to sign.
Ministers STANDINS and Lavrov have also discussed the current situation on freight carriers at the border of Latvia and Russia.
As a result of the increased customs controls of the Russian Federation, the situation in the Russian Russian border is dramatic and the border to release the border in half of the Latvian side requires a swift solution, because it is causing significant losses, commented in the telephone conversation. Minister RIEKSTINS.
Ministers agreed that the respective institutions of both countries, including the Latvijas Association in Latvijas Auto, should continue their efforts to normalise the situation in the near future, in accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Transport, 18 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Transport. an agreement reached on December.

Dear Miss Coling:
My name is Susan Harris, and I'm writing about Lockwood High School for students.
We'd like to invite you to take part in a special event that's going on in our school.
Your arrival would be honored.
Please respond at the latest by Monday 26 February to confirm your presence.
We hope to see you here,
Sincerely, Susan Harris.
In 2007, the most powerful particle accelerator, the Ner Large Hadron Collider, has predominantly measured the secrets of the energy, which was only moments after the Great Pauku.
In the presence of the children, the scientists expect to find information about previous forms of light on the speed of light, using the energy that has separated from the impact.
What is expected of this great investment that Europe has done to the production of LHC?
It sends two protons of protons, particles formed by the atomic core and belonging to the particle family, in different directions, in a circle of 27 km in length below Switzerland and France.
Strong magnetic fields are required by superconductors, materials that are capable of driving electricity, or energy sources. lose and work very low temperatures, produced in cooperation with the European industry.
The impact of the protons at the speed of the eighth million per second of the vast energy mix of 14 TEV.
To understand the magnitude of this figure, the 1 TEV is about the amount of energy that is used by a flying mosquito to move.
However, in the LHC, this energy amount will be concentrated on a smaller area of one million times when it is a bug.
As energy can be transferred to particles according to a limited relaxation principle (E = mc2), physicians are expected to create particles that have never been looked at in speeds.
The frequency and intensity of collisions are important as they make the possibility of seeing particles in order to see the appearance of particles.
There are two main nuclear speeds of which are energy candles with 1 150 to TeV, but with fewer collisions per second.
The search for super symmetrics...
The sensors are capable of analysing the impact.
Two of these names are CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and Atlas (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus).
They're concentrating on the detection of super symmetrical particles and the bosons of Higgs.
What's a super symmetry?
The physics physically contain several symmetry, for example, as a cortex and an antimace.
The Supersymmetry binds fermion (for building material to the ground, such as e-mails and blocks) with the bosom (channelling the transfer, such as foil) and vice versa.
The challenge is that the super-symmetry (also designated in the form of the antiparticles) has never been looked at before.
How to discover them?
Paradoxically, in their absence!
"it's a little like being a movie.
You count the number and type of people entering and out.
If a person is missing at the end of the day, because you know who moved, you can guess who didn't. "
In the same way, the LHC asserters know that these antiparticles, which are invisible to all sensors, are likely to arise as a result of a certain degree of collisions.
Before collision energy, they compare the energy of particulate matter after collision.
If there are differences in energy, the particles have escaped.
By calculating the energy, they know whether the supersymmetry component or the antiques are involved.
The second challenge of the cms and the LHS sensors is the detection of the bosons of Higgs.
In the case of a standard model model theory, it is assumed that it should be reciprocally and give them a mass.
How?
Let's assume that there's a dozen physics students.
Suddenly, Albert Einstein comes into the room, the students reconvene around him, and they're going to bomb him with questions.
If Albert's trying to move, he'll feel a certain inertia on his side of the clinic students.
He's similar to these particles than the superiors of the Higgs' bosons to exert their influence - they collect the mass.
Here, too, the anticipated detection of these famous bosons can only be indirect: particles, which arise as a result of their degradation, are the ones that are discovered.
Kvargi-gluoni soup
The third sensor with which LHC is equipped will be called Alice (Major of the Ionian Model experiment).
The aim is to detect unidentified nuclear physics, especially the supplements that were present in a very short period of time after the Great Pauku, and known as a quarter-guplon-plasma name.
What is the new specificities?
In the '60s, scientists realized that the protons and neutralising the atom of the atom were even even more from the original particles - the blocks.
These blocks are linked to a strong force (which target particles name gluons) are linked.
One of them is that they are diverse together: they are always either in pairs or in threes; they cannot exist alone.
The more you try to extract the Kvark from the second quarter, the greater the cohesive force that keeps them together, making them permanently unseparable.
On the blocks, they say they're in jail.
However, if the proton bombers are bombed against each other, a quarter and a soup containing glucons, which are free to move freely.
Then we can make a reference to the release of the quarks in a quarter-glue soup.
Why do you want to get rid of that?
"This is somewhat comparable with skiing.
If there are not much snow, the runners can be separated by grass and skiers are limited to their establishment.
On the other hand, if there's a lot of snow, they can change the path.
They are free from restrictions. "
Instead of snow, physicists add energy: the greater the energy of the quarter, the weaker is a cohesive force, so the safe at a higher level of energy can be separated.
The plasma of Krongi-gluon was likely to be a straightforward for microseconds after the Great Pauku.
This is the reason why physicians want to investigate it by means of an ion irradiation using LHC.
In their very nature, these protons and neutrons are very rich.
They can achieve energy 1 150 TEV, which is necessary to plasma levels of quargi-gluon, which was unprecedented in the beginning of the Universe, for the purpose of establishing and investigating the Universe.
Riddles of antimailing
Finally, the last sensor called LHCb (big Hadron's fastest beauty).
The task is to better monitor the strange differences between the ground and the antimace so that it can better understand what happened to the ancient universe.
For each part of the section, the antiques, which are among the same characteristics, have the same mass, but the counterparty.
Therefore, there is a level of equal mass for electronic electrons, but the appropriate antielectrical (or positron) of a positive loan.
If the power and the antipower get together, they will destroy each other, and I will have the energy pressure.
According to the standard physics standard model, the amount of the universe was created at the beginning of the Universe.
So all particles should destroy each other, and the universe should be empty.
However, as anyone can see, there is a painful makeup.
This is where the question that LHCb is trying to answer: where is it an antimace?
One of the possible responses is based on the ability of certain particles to make themselves known and vice versa.
In this case, the presence of the ground depends on the hypothesis (which awaits proof) that the conversion of anti-particle transformation into particles is dependent on the opposite rate of transformation at the beginning of the universe.
Can there be an imbalance in this kind of imbalance?
It's actually experimental with the quarterly particle types being called cafes.
The Antagonists will be spontaneously spontaneously, but it is much less frequent in the opposite direction.
LHCb is investigating the second candidate, a B messac containing (among other things) elements of the element (or the part thereof) known as B block or decorator (where the name of LCHb comes from.).
Although the particles can't be seen, it can be detected.
For this purpose, the LHC shall be equipped with equipment containing a number of concentrial layers (such as onions), surrounded by a particle beam where the impact is carried out.
Each layer specializes in the detection of a certain type of thing.
In the middle of the sensor, there's a chamber in the chamber, there are millions of halls that produce an electric pulse when the particles go against it.
These impulses are recorded by computers, which makes it possible to reconstruct these trajectories.
There's a magnetic field inside each sensor.
This helps to detect and investigate the trajectory of the loaded particles (e.g. power or protons) which are sensitive to the magnetic field.
The second equipment is the founding sensor of the calorific family.
Some calorimeters stop particles, like photons or electrons, but others have been designed to stop the neutrons and photons.
They measure the energy losses that have undergone them.
Aid for the strings
How can the essence of algosa be defined as part of the mechanisms leading to their creation?
Apart from the physics model model (resulting in quantum mechanics), modern science has concentrated its hopes for the new acquiree, which would provide a high level of mathematical stress theory.
It's an outlook for a completely new type of experiment in CERN.
The standard model (the cornerstone of modern physics, which was poorly introduced during the 20th century), must be defined as the precision of elementary elements that led to three particles that are known to be influenced by the three particles: electromagnetic ism and strong and weak. you're the power.
It allows us to provide a description that is well suited to what is happening in this endlessly small world.
However, this model does not take into account the gravity of gravity.
Now, quantum physics, when the light presents itself with a particle, footprint, the gravity of gravity must be transferred to another particle, a graviton.
In the search for harmonisation
This is therefore an obstacle to describing this part of a standard model (see boxing).
In addition, at the beginning, the Universe was so extreme and extraordinarily massive (all the energy and the ground was concentrated in a very small volume).
Consequently, the theory also describes the particles that previously dominated in this period, cannot be excluded from gravity.
How can we combine to all this general relativity theory (out of Einstein at the beginning of the last century), which is revolving around gravity?
"quantum mechanics harmonisation and general relativity theory has become the real Holy Grail of physics."
The scientists are working on this problem.
The most promising path seems to be a scene theory. "
From the point to strings
What does this theory tell us about the world?
First of all, it is looking at particles not as points, but as the elements that can be compared with extremely small strings that are 10-35 metres long (number 1 preceded by 35 zero, the first one on the left.).
These strings are vibrating and the nature of their vibrations correspond to the different types of particles.
The more string vibrates, the greater the share of the corresponding share of energy.
One of the continuum theory, which is necessary for its mathematical integrity, is a super-symmetry.
To understand what this is, a brief description of the "zoology" of the basic particles is necessary.
Kvantkehad in the universe can be divided into two families: on the one hand there are fermions, where electronic and quarks belong, on the other side, the bosons' family, which includes particles of fundamentals, like the photons that target electromagnetic power, and graviton (above) gravity.
The problem of the super symmetry
The Supersymmetry consists of a presumption that every part of the fermion family corresponds to a part of the family belonging to the boss and vice versa, so the symmetry idea.
The super-symmetrical part has not yet been detected, but the physicians are relying on their face with high energy in collisions which they will soon create using the LHC, a new central rate of CERN..
In the meantime, astronomes may indirectly monitor the effects of these myocardial particles, as the total mass of the galaxies and the galaxy sets appears to be much higher than the luminous mass (the letters, gases, etc.), there's an astronomy with telescopes.
They therefore possess an invisible mass of black mass, which is reciprocally with other continents only through its gravity, and contains very stable, thus very light particles.
There are a number of key features that the easiest super-symmetry particles share.
These may therefore be of unknown black mass constituents, the phenomenon which was first examined by the Italian astronomic Fritz Zwicky in 1933.
Four interactions between single interactions
The second issue, which is problematic for researchers, concerns the fundamental interaction of the four months of nature.
Why are their strengths so different from each other?
For example, the strength of gravity is much less weaker than the electromagnetic interaction.
The proof of this is that the magnetic field of the magnetic field is sufficient to attract a relatively large metal mass, whereas the whole planet is needed to move the same mass by means of gravity.
One question to this question is that all the fundamental interactions are only one of the interplay with an extremely high energy source which started falling at the beginning of the Universe.
