## Slurm scripts
Slurm scripts are under the slurm-scripts folder sorted by submissions.

Add index in front of slurm scripts, so its clearly understandable, which script to run first.

Would be nice if indexes were aligned with task numbers in submissions.

Also move the script into the right folder.
