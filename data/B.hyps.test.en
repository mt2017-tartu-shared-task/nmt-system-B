Language, literature, artistic, imaginative arts, architecture, crafts, cinema and broadcasting are all part of Europe's cultural diversity.
The European Union has two objectives: to maintain and support this diversity and to make it available to others.
EU cultural industries – cinema and audiovisual industry, publishing, music and crafts – are all important sources of revenue and job providers, employing some seven million people.
The Union has economic responsibility for this area and seeks to ensure the right conditions for the European industry to be competitive at international level.
Thus, the EU has launched programmes to support certain branches of cultural industries, encouraging them to exploit the opportunities offered by the single market and digital technologies.
The EU also seeks to create a dynamic environment for these industries by facilitating access to finance, contributing to research projects and fostering cooperation with the internal and external partners of the Union.
The Union is also involved in many other policies, such as education (including language learning), research, new technologies and information society, and social and regional development.
For example, the European Social Fund is supported by the European Social Fund for Arturo Toscanin, which has organised courses on musicians since the mid-1990s.
The specific objectives of the current Culture Programme are to promote awareness of important cultural objects at European level and to promote their retention; to promote transnational mobility of workers in the cultural sector; encourage transnational distribution of works and cultural and artistic works; encouraging intercultural dialogue.
The "Media" programmes aimed at making the European audiovisual sector more dynamic and competitive has worked since the mid-1990s.
Each year, the European Capitals of Culture will be selected each year and will give them the right to receive financial support.
Linguistic diversity is the cornerstone of culture and democracy in the European Union.
The language not only is an opening of the door to other cultures, but also gives us the opportunity to get part of cultural contacts when travelling to other countries.
It is estimated that 40 million people in the EU speak as a mother tongue, which is not the state of origin of their country of origin.
The objective of the common agricultural policy is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers, to provide consumers with high quality food prices and to maintain our ground.
The number of beef and veal, and the milk lake, has already been twenty years in the past due to the first wave of reforms.
Our main source of information and entertainment is television.
Each of us is on average on average three hours a day, sports broadcasts, films and other paths.
The government of each Member State has its own audiovisual policy, while the Union lays down rules and guidelines for common interests, such as the EU and open borders and fair competition.
In order to protect its cultural diversity and to promote local products, the EU's World Trade Organisation has requested a so-called cultural exception to be achieved.
As a result of the speed of technological innovation, broadcasting and telecommunications have progressed to each other.
Open borders and transport at affordable prices have given Europeans an unprecedented personal freedom of movement.
Goods are being transported quickly and efficiently from an undertaking to consumers who are often in different countries.
The European Union has contributed to opening up the internal market and removing physical and technical barriers to freely moving freely.
However, the current transport patterns and growth rates are not sustainable.
The capacity of the fast, efficient and cheap transport of people and goods is a guiding principle for the EU's dynamic economy and a coherent society.
The removal of barriers to cross-border trade and travel has increased the volume of long-distance transport of goods and passengers.
Although many aspects of transport policy fall within the scope of the Member States, it is sensible if a single transport infrastructure is a single European market.
Over the past ten years, the EU has opened public transport markets across the Union, in particular the road and air transport sector and a less rail transport sector.
As a result, lorries may also be taken in other than in the countries other than those in the home countries, so that they do not return to the international voyage.
Road haulage is now transported by 44% of all goods in the EU, with 39% transporting short sea roads, 10% of railways and 34% of inland waterways.
The transition from road passenger transport to low-polluting modes of transport is a key factor in any sustainable transport policy.
The European Union (EU) is a family of democratic European countries committed to peace and prosperity.
The EU is not a country which should replace the existing countries, as well as the international cooperation organisation.
The historic beginnings of the Europass Union go back to the Second World War.
The idea was, therefore, that Europeans decided to avoid the repetition of such killing and destruction.
Six countries cooperated in the early years, mainly in the area of trade and economic activity.
There are now 27 countries and 490 million people in the EU, and it deals with many different issues that are directly relevant to our daily lives.
Europe is a continent of many different traditions and languages, but it also has common values, such as democracy, freedom and social justice.
In the 21st century in which countries are increasingly dependent on each other, it is increasingly important for every European citizen to cooperate with other countries in the spirit of curiosity, openness and solidarity.
You can travel through a larger part of the EU without passport and without being suspended for border control.
The EU's story from the Schuman Declaration and six Member States from the EU in the 1950s until the 2007 enlargement and 27 Member States.
On 9 May 1950, the Schuman Declaration proposed to establish the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which would serve as a sausage agreement with the Paris Agreement of 18 April 1951.
The customs duties between six countries were fully lifted on 1 July 1968 and common policies were introduced in the 1960s, in particular the trade and agricultural policy.
In June 1979, the European Community made a decisive step forward, as the first direct and general elections of the European Parliament took place.
The European political statue was significantly altered by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
In March 2000, the EU adopted the Lisbon Strategy for the modernisation of the European economy and to enable it to compete with other important actors on the world market, such as the USA and the new-industrialised countries.
The traveman has so much to discover and the European Union has made it much easier.
You can overcome many frontiers without control in the EU, and the euro makes it easier for the euro.
The Green Card is not mandatory for travel in the EU, but it is an internationally recognised insurance certificate and facilitates the satisfaction of the claims arising from accidents.
The creation of a single European market in air transport has meant lower fares and a broader range of airlines and services for passengers.
There are 210 000 km of railways in the EU with various international passenger services.
In several countries, the high-speed train lines with a speed of up to 300 km / h and this year will be extended to new connections in Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Latvia on the shore of the Baltic Sea is low land in large forests, where the construction and paper industries are put in place.
It also produces consumer and textiles and work tensions.
The population comprises 59% of Latvian and 29% of the Russians, and over a third of the population lives in the capital of the capital.
Riga was the largest city of the Baltic States, the inhabitants of the Baltic Sea are 730 000.
The unequivocal Parliament of Latvia will be elected by direct universal suffrage every four years.
The President is elected by Parliament, as well as every four years.
The typical roses of Latvian kitchens are bachelor tubes and a cold refreshing cut.

The revision of the online exchange of information over the recent period has led to more multilingual progress towards a multilingual natural language.
Recently, there has been a growing interest in the automatic identification of the same expressions in the various languages.
New exciting trends have arisen, such as the use of the web and comparable language arrangements for it, and the focus of attention has been made by new decrees, such as those of a number of expressions and successes.
The seminar brings together researchers dealing with a variety of problems related to the management of multilingual language equipment: their acquisition, management, adjustment and reuse.
The seminar will provide an assessment of multilingual flags intended for very different applications: the translation project adaptations to the translation project to the complex machine-readable language curricula and databases.
International test fusion reactor, an important test facility designed to demonstrate that the production of fusion energy is scientifically and technically feasible.
Science and innovation will help create jobs, improve prosperity and quality of life.
After successful attempts by recent years, nuclear fusion energy research and development have reached the point where effective progress can be expected towards sustainable energy production by fusion.
"Knowledge is a key factor in competitiveness", said European Research Commissioner Janez Potočnik.
If our businesses have to play a leading role in the future, they must invest in knowledge right now and governments must take appropriate measures to assist them.
The EU is part of a globalised world where knowledge is more evenly distributed than ever.
The fusion of fusion offers the possibility of producing almost unlimited amounts of pure energy over a long period of time.
The low level of private R & D spending in Europe compared with the US is mainly due to differences in the industrial fabric and that the European high-tech industry is smaller.
As regards the level of scientific excellence, although the EU is the world's largest scientific knowledge creator, the impact of European research is less than the US's science.
Europe is lagging behind in all scientific disciplines in terms of the impact of citates and the number of quoted jobs in the United States.
The EU universities are also highly under-represented on the top of the ranges of the ranges of the largest universities in the world.
In addition, the link between the technology (patented inventions) and the science base in the EU is much weaker than in the US.
Europe has a hard way to achieve a breakthrough in the new high-tech industry.
Today, a new discovery of R & D funding began when the European Commission adopted proposals to launch a first EU-wide public and private R & D partnership.
In order to ensure our competitiveness and prosperity, Europe needs a new approach in certain promising areas.
These are areas where public funding for research at national, European level and industry provides much less added value, creating favourable assumptions for greater funding for research and development by the private sector.
The invisible computers (embedded systems) today run all machinery from cars, aircraft and telephones, from energy networks and plants to washing machines and televisions.
It is predicted that over the year 2010 there are more than 16 billion manoeuvres, and more than 40 billion devices worldwide exist worldwide by 2020.
By 2010, these invisible chips account for 30-40% of the value of new products in consumer electronics (41%), telecoms (37%), car (36%) and medical devices (33%).
The Innovative Medicines Initiative supports the development of new knowledge, equipment and methods to allow faster and safer use of safer medicines.
Today, the European Commission is presenting its ideas on the European Research Area, which represents the potential of most European knowledge.
The Commission's aim is to introduce this potential, enabling people, infrastructure, organisations, funding sources, knowledge exchanges and global cooperation to operate effectively.
Better knowledge and use of knowledge is essential if the EU wants to achieve its economic, social and social objectives listed in the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.
Our future depends on whether Europe can become a truly knowledge-based society.
The European Research Area is the basis for which this knowledge society needs to be built.
Businesses have difficulty in creating partnerships with universities, in particular universities located in other countries.
Researchers are still confronted with obstacles to their career development or other EU research.
The national and regional funding of research is largely uncoordinated and therefore ineffective.
The use of research results could be significantly improved.
The document is accompanied by guidelines that help research institutions to improve links with industry, underlining good knowledge and intellectual property management and exchange practices.
There are enough researchers who are very mobile between institutions, research areas, sectors and countries, one of the main axes.
The aim of the Directive is to achieve a good level of the quality of all rivers, lakes, beams waters, coastal waters and groundwater.
Sustainable water management is vital for the protection of biodiversity, the well-being of citizens and the competitiveness of European industries.
The participating partners will benefit from greater visibility, increased research and development capacity, better financial incentives and a reduction of risk associated costs.
Companies are directly involved in research and education, thereby contributing to supporting entrepreneurial mindsets among graduates and researchers.
The European Commission has now taken the view on how to modernise Europe's universities.
European universities have enormous potential, a large part of which remains untapped because of the rigidities and the various obstacles.
The release of large knowledge, talents and energy resources requires an immediate, comprehensive and coordinated change: from the mode of regulation and management of the systems to the methods of governance of universities.
While universities training and teach millions of people every year, European higher education systems are still a number of obstacles, many of which are old for decades.
Universities are the driving force for the creation of knowledge.
Universities need to adapt to the demands of a global, knowledge-based economy, as is the case for other sectors of society and economy.
Each institution should find a balance between education, research and innovation, which is best suited to its role in its region or country.
The aim is to create a framework in which schools can become stronger players in a global knowledge-based society and in the economy.
The Commission is ready to support the modernisation of the EU universities through the process of identifying and sharing good practice and through its education, research and innovation funding programmes.
The European Commission has identified nine areas where changes should be made in such a way that European universities can contribute to the creation of a genuine knowledge-based economy.
One of the proposals is to enable students to use national loans and subsidies across the EU, where they decide to study or make science.
We need to change the national tuition and support schemes so that the best students can participate in higher education and continue their research careers, regardless of their background.
We need to change university funding systems so that they focus on the outcome and enable universities to take greater responsibility for their own long-term financial sustainability, especially in research.
We need to make more autonomy and responsibility for universities so that they can react quickly to changes.
This may include a review of curricula to adapt to new developments, the introduction of closer relations between research areas and focus on general scientific disciplines instead of specific scientific disciplines (e.g. renewable energy, nanotechnology).
It may also include a greater degree of autonomy at the selection of teaching and scientific staff at the level of a specific institution.
In all EU Member States, safety belts must now be confirmed in all vehicles, including tourism buses and microbuses.
Please note that in Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom on the left side of the road, remember that in some countries, such as Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Portugal, you will normally have to do a better approach to vehicle approaching vehicles.
The use of mobile phones during the driving time of the vehicle significantly increases the risk of life-threatening accidents and is prohibited directly or indirectly in all EU Member States.
Although in most EU Member States, the maximum allowable alcohol content of 0.5 mg / ml is 0,2 mg / ml up to 0,8 mg / ml (0,9 mg / ml in Cyprus) and in some countries at all times in the blood. to be alcohol.
When travelling in the EU, the passenger insurance policy automatically provides the insurance cover required by the minimum law (motor insurance).
The speed limit is generally 110, 120 or 130 km / h on motorways, with 50 or sometimes 60 km / h.
As an air carrier, you have a number of rights in relation to flight and reservation information, baggage damage, delays and denied flights, non-authorisation, accidents or accidents.
These rights apply to both domestic and international liner and on-demand flights from one EU airport or from outside EU airports to the EU air carrier.
New rules on liquids that passengers can carry through airport control points are introduced.

Now the Treaty establishing the EU Treaty is applicable to the coal and steel sector.
Such agreements shall always be concluded between entities subject to international law (Member States or organisations) with a view to establishing international cooperation.
International agreements are the second source of EU legislation, enabling the European Union to develop economic, social and political relations with the rest of the world.
Agreements concluded under the first pillar of the European Union are binding on the Union and Member States; agreements concluded under the second and third pillar within the Union are binding on the institutions, but not always for the Member States.
The Association Agreements cover close economic cooperation with a comprehensive financial contribution from the Community to the contractual partner.
Cooperation agreements are not as comprehensive as the association agreements, as only close economic cooperation is concerned.
Trade agreements have been concluded in customs and commercial policy agreements concluded with a group of non-Union countries or in the framework of international trade organisations.

Secondary legislation is a third largest source of Community legislation after the Treaties (primary legislation) and international agreements.
Secondary legislation covers binding acts under the EC Treaty (regulations, directives and decisions) and non-binding acts (resolutions, opinions), together with a whole range of other acts such as internal rules and Community action programmes.
The second and third pillars, which, in fact, are not part of secondary legislation, as they continue to be regulated by intergovernmental relations, are subject to proper documentation of this category.
The Regulation adopted jointly by the Council and the European Parliament or only the Regulation adopted by the Commission is the main measure of binding nature.
Unlike directives aimed at Member States, and decisions aimed at specific recipients, regulations are aimed at all.
The Regulation is directly applicable, which means that it will be created in all Member States with immediate entry into force as well as national legislation, without State authorities to do so in addition to them.
